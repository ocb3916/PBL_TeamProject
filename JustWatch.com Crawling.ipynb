I couldn't have been more wrong, especially because \"The Boys\" it's not about a desperate attempt of superheroes to save the world from evil, instead this show takes a much more realistic approach, about what is going to happen if superheroes had really existed.I'm saying that I had big expectations in the beginning, because I thought that it would be the same usual show with superheroes and villain, that is most likely to find everywhere. In the first couple of episodes I've been a little bit disappointed, or rather shocked, because like I've already said, \"The Boys\" describes what the MCU never did. Of course, the movies and shows from Marvel are destined to other public's category, but this show is tough. It has all you could not expect from a TV series with superheroes. It has violence, gore, nudity, astonishing CGI effects and a very unpredictable and solid storyline. In the end it seems that this one delivered what I didn't expect it to and I am pleased with that. The show is definitely worth watching.\n",

Would you even imagine the franchise we would have to endure if they came into real life! This franchise would become The One quite easily. Here comes this The Boys !Easily might become the greatest first season of A Superhero TV show ever, competing with Marvels Daredevil ofcourse. But this scrip is so freaking impressive, the over the top violence and gore along with great dialogues and brilliant acting easily brings it to the top. i would be really surprised if the two KIWI lead protagonists, Kurl Urban and Anthony Starr wouldn't get nominated for best actors in a leading role, specially Starr. He was absolutely brilliant as the lead antagonist Homelander. That says something for a superhero movie, wouldn't you say !Was waiting patiently for this show, and living up to that hype was not easy. Had to binge it at once, it's that addictive. Wow! Before even release, Amazon Prime ordered a second season even though the production cost might have been astronomical I would imagine. They were that confident, this was that good. Watch it, you'll enjoy !!\n",

      "There's nothing more that I can really say about The Boys that hasn't already been said. It's just a flat out awesome show! It's easily become one of my favorite new shows in years! I binged the entire first two seasons in just a few days when they first came out and rewatched them again for the second time before Season 3 came out. I was expecting a little bit of a drop off for Season 3 because Season 1 and 2 were so great, and there is a little drop in quality but it's still a very good show! It takes everything you loved about Season 1 and 2 (the violence, humor, heart, craziness, character development, etc.) and takes it all to a whole new level! This show has such an original take on the Superhero genre that is both exciting and hilarious! I can not recommend this show enough! Just a warning though...once you start watching it it's hard to stop. Give yourself enough time because you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!\n",

A definite must watch - that would definitely be our world with supes!!They dwell on topics such as sexual harrasment, drug abuse, collateral damage and co-dependence like no one else is doing on TV - congrats Amazon and cast!\n",

      "The Boys is one of the best Superhero shows I've ever seen. While Season 1 was the best season of the series, Season 2 and 3 were also both very good and absolutely worth watching. Season 3 was fantastic, Jensen Ackles was the perfect actor to add to this already incredible show! This show continues to amaze as it's not afraid to try new things and is a show that is definitely for adults. It has no problems being offensive and making you feel squeamish. You don't even have to be a fan of superhero shows to enjoy this. It's violent, funny, thrilling, etc.. Everything you want in a good superhero show. Season 4 just added Jeffrey Dean Morgan to the cast. Another great addition to an already incredible cast. I don't know what else I can say except I absolutely love this series and can't wait for more to come!\n",

      "The boys started really well, but from the last episode of season 3, the show has been going downhill. The story has stopped progressing, and the creators are only adding stuff to generate shocking reactions from viewers. Unfortunately, this isn't working anymore. Weird scenes looked good when the story was moving forward, but now that it isn't, I am just unable to watch it anymore. The performances of all the actors are good, but the writing has been really bad. The characters are making weird choices that don't match their personalities, and the attempt to stretch things out is very visible on screen. All in all, The Boys has fallen off.\n",

      "This Amazon series is set in a world where there are superheroes; they aren't typical superheroes though; they work for the powerful Vought Corporation and consider ratings and profit to be more important than saving lives. They are also arrogant, disillusioned or generally unpleasant. The worst of these are 'The Seven', the most senior heroes who are heavily marketed by Vought. Working to expose them is a group known as 'The Boys'; led by Billy Butcher who is convinced that leader of the heroes, Homelander, is responsible for the disappearance of his wife. We are introduced to each group via new members; Hughie Campbell joins The Boys after ultrafast hero A-Train ran through his girlfriend; and Annie January an idealistic young heroine known as Starlight who joins The Seven. Hughie and Annie become friends before learning what the other is doing.When I first heard of this I thought it was just a case of Amazon jumping on the superhero bandwagon but then heard a radio review which made it sound like a series I might like... it most certainly is! If you like your heroes to be heroic and good rather than self-centred egomaniacs you might not like this but if you like to see conventions turned on their head this is great. Another major difference between this and more typical stories featuring superheroes is that this is definitely not family friendly; there is a lot of strong violence, some sex and nudity and possibly the most swearing I've heard in a TV show. The story develops well over the two seasons that are currently available with some good twists and plenty of interesting character development. The characters on both sides are interesting and the cast does a great job portraying them. While the story can be a bit dark at times it is lightened by its humour; often being genuinely hilarious as we see events that wouldn't seem the most obvious source of laughs. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to older superhero fans who are looking for something different. I can't wait for season three.\n",

There were times when I thought that the 'good guys' were the 'bad guys', and times when I thought the 'bad guys' were the 'good guys'.

      "The plot of the show suffers from constant political posturing that is obviously meant to reflect a criticism of conservatism, with the occasional jabs at leftism. This posturing is no longer subtle and forces viewers to be lectured and not entertained.At times the political satire is humorous, but it is so overly used that this show is no longer a parody of superheroism - it simply reminds the audience of real-world ideologies they are trying to escape. It is as if for a moment, the producers have forgotten audiences are aware of these tensions and that we need to be reminded of who is 'right' or who is 'wrong'.In contrast to prior seasons, season four prioritizes too many story lines at one time, and with what appears to be filler plot lines that no one cares about.**SPOILERS BELOW: Frenchie, for example, is no longer the tech savant that viewers grew to know and love. He is somehow the victim of a cringe, sexual identity crisis and is fluent in crying and getting beaten up, all after building up his relationship with Kimiko for three seasons.Terrible way to continue the series and I suspect views will decline as will the quality. Of course there are positives: Homelander's descent into madness and the murder of the lab workers who abused him, and Butcher coming to terms with the end of his life.Ultimately, all this season has to show for is the careful examination of a select few characters and what drives them thematically, and the violent / sexual absurdities that provoke shock value amongst the audience. Only time will tell if producers can course correct.\n",

      "It's a sad year for The Boys.. What started as a captivating and entertaining show, has devolved into a painful hour of viewing each week. I could easily binge the first 2 seasons seasons (and even season 3 for the most part)... but the subtle & clever political undertones of earlier seasons, which were an afterthought to the storyline & character building, has become the sole purpose of the show now it seems. I barely get through each new episode, but continue to hold on in the hopes of some kind of glimpse of The Boys seasons I fell in love with in the first place. There are still a few good scenes and humor sprinkled in, but it's mostly just the writer shoving their extreme political view down your throat every chance they get. It's becoming predictable and very repetitive at this point. I hope things will start to get better, and I'll most likely tough it out for the remainder of the season as something to put on in the background while I'm doing other stuff, but if it continues this trajectory, I won't be around for season 5 (if it even gets there).\n",

      "(Review updated after Season 4).Hughie Campbell's life is turned upside down when the love of his life is accidentally killed by a superhero, a member of The Seven, the most elite and adored of superhero teams. The Seven are the rock stars of the age and untouchable but the more Hughie investigates, the more he discovers they're far from perfect. His moral crusade sees him drawn into a band of anti-superhero vigilantes: The Boys.I'm generally not into superhero movies or series but this is different. Here the superheroes are more the villains than the heroes, making for a very interesting and original take on the genre. Throw in some very intriguing sub-plots involving the superheroes' private lives, the politics of their jobs and machinations within their team plus some profound observations and themes involving the (forced) superficiality of public figures, the intrusiveness and control of the media and the influence of social media status and you have a series that is original, entertaining and a mirror of the times.Action scenes are well done, with some great CGI and graphic grittiness - this is definitely not Disney! While mostly a drama there's some wonderfully funny moments too. Just about anything involving The Deep was always bound to raise a laugh.Not perfect though. The central plot - The Boys vs the superheroes - often appears clumsy and seems to go around in circles. It starts well enough but after a point, towards the end of Season 1, it just seems to get bogged down in endless escapades that have no point and occur based on the flimsiest of excuses. Plus these escapades often got resolved in silly, plot hole-riddled ways.The writers would have done better to initially concentrate on the internal machinations within The Seven with the superheroes vs The Boys plot starting as a sideshow and then amping it up as the series went on.Things do come together quite well in Season 3 though as the plot finds its focus. Season 3 is action-packed and intriguing with some great internal machinations within the superhero camp and a very interesting new character. It was heading for a fantastic showdown but the writers fluffed this somewhat in an effort to prolong the series. The final episode of S3 is a bit confusing and disappointing.This disappointment continues into S4 as the main plot doesn't develop much. Instead we have heaps of sub-plots that don't add much and are just there to kill time. I was expecting showdown between The Boys and the superheroes but instead we have heaps of politics, all very polarising and I assume meant to be some sort of commentary on US politics and society. Before there was some engagement with the superheroes, now they're just plain cartoonish, malevolent villains. The middle of the season is the low point with meaningless space filler galore.Things do improve towards the end and the season ends on a high. However, I suspect that S5 will be more of the same: two or three episodes of plot development, five or six episodes of padding. Why would the producers give us a tight, development-filled plot when they can stretch this out for several more seasons and make more money that way?Season ratings: S1&2 8/10, S3 9/10, S4 6/10.\n",
