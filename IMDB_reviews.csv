0,For those who didn't like the movie because of its second half,mysticfall,18 October 2019,10,"It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year."
1,One of the best films of this decade,Jeremy_Urquhart,5 July 2019,10,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.
Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there."
2,"You name a genre, this movie covers it",jtindahouse,6 October 2019,8,"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too."
3,Meritocracy: it's metaphorical,nehpetstephen,25 August 2019,10,"In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."
4,"Engaging as a drama, with an intelligent social aspect to it",bob the moo,16 August 2020,No rating,"A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the 'con' itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the 'truth' as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition, but it is a handsome, clever film and the timing in the year is right - I don't see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture, but this is more to do with the system than with the film. Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative."
5,A true masterpiece.,keezo9uno,19 August 2019,10,"This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you belly laugh, it will chill you to the bone, and it will make you shed a tear. This movie will stay with you long after the credits are over.If you plan on watching this movie, AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS."
6,An original dark comedy about class struggles,impeyrules-54634,12 January 2020,9,This is a well written and well perfomed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.
7,Thoroughly entertaining,Leofwine_draca,1 November 2020,10,"PARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, a talent I've long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago. He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax. A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think."
8,A brilliant piece of art which will slowly grows on you!,sandeepventrapragada98,19 August 2019,10,Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss Mr. Bong joon-ho's Parasite. Definitely tops the list of best movies in 2019.
9,Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us,DJKwa,2 July 2019,9,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."
10,The movie was entertaining but not Oscar-worthy,radrobd,9 April 2020,7,"I found the movie entertaining. I was expecting more duplicity and schemes from the Kim family once they infiltrated the rich family. It moved slow at first but picked up pace towards the middle. While I was entertained, I was shocked that this movie won the 2019 Academy Award for Best Picture over the far superior 1917."
11,One of the most thought provoking films I've ever seen,tmcapitals,5 November 2019,10,"Do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots, anxious during many scenes? Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite.
Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that.
The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations."
12,I'm baffled by the over the top praise.,dacorn-00765,19 February 2020,6,"The film is interesting, but that's about it. The first hour was really slow, the whole class thing seemed quite familiar. I'm not sure why people are falling over themselves about this film, maybe since it was Korean yet with an accessible story and familiar film language that it suddenly moved westerners to 'see the light'? Anyway, the second half twists and turns struck me more as a wacky story line I would have seen on a soap opera back in the day like Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives. Overall, I'm more critical of the critics than of the film. I recommend seeing this, it's worth a look but all the Oscars and 'best film of the decade' stuff is incomprehensible."
13,OVERRATED - OVERRATED - OVERRATED,Mustang92,31 December 2019,5,"This movie is not a ""masterpiece"" by any means. And all the apparent hype it's getting? Why? Is it because this is a foreign film trying to be an ""American film""? (That is, trying to be an American ""genre"" film?)THE GOOD:The actors are good.Some good cinematography. Definitely some cool scenes, like the flooding late in the film.The twist near the middle of the film is a good twist. However, it's like 50 minutes in, and it's too late. The film is semi-boring up to that point.THE BAD:We've all seen those less-than-stellar films, where the criminals make one stupid horrible decision after another. Not the comedies where it's supposed to be funny or dumb, but the serious films. And you sit there thinking, ""Man, these criminals are effing morons, it's just NOT believable. You've seen those, right? Well, this is one of those.I could suspend my disbelief over one bad decision, even two. But every single one? It's just not believable, because the criminals are good at pulling off their cons and getting all employed by the wealthy family. But once they're all in and making buck... then they all become stupid? Doesn't work.The bad decisions start when the wealthy family goes camping, and the criminals decide to hang out, get drunk and make a mess in the wealthy family's living room. Even one of them foreshadows the wealthy family coming home unexpectedly by mentioning it as a ""what if."" Next bad decision is they let in the former housekeeper who shows up unexpectedly. Really??Then the next bad decision is how they handle the housekeeper and her husband. Once the criminals are being held hostage by the threat of disclosure, why wouldn't even just one of them think of trying to negotiate something? Oh, sure, one of them eventually does, but like 30 minutes later when it's too late.The film feels too slow until we get to the twist in the story. Twist should really have happened within maybe first 30 minutes. Not halfway through the movie. And then, when it does happen, we're down the road of the criminal family making multiple bad decisions.Minor point, but the housekeeper's husband who's been living under the house for something like 4 years, looked too healthy. Someone living in cave-like conditions for 4 years with no sun, is not going to look healthy.All in all, not the worst film I've ever seen, but NOT deserving of the high praise and ratings it's getting here. And not deserving of the Academy Award for Best Picture. Sorry."
14,Society can only be as strong as its most vulnerable people,southbankcinema,26 May 2019,No rating,"Parasite (Gisaengchung), the 2019 film by Bong Joon-ho, taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between rich and poor around the world.The film, delivering a strong social commentary that can be interpreted at a universal level, follows two families on opposite sides of the social and financial totem pole. It is a darkly entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family living in a filthy basement and the rich Park family, the polar opposites of our protagonists. The film makes you play a guessing game of which of the two families are the most rotten.Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. The devil is in the detail in this grotesque critique of social inequality and the psychology of money."
15,Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea,perica-43151,16 January 2020,9,"This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell ""like butter"" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie."
16,It's so metaphorical,joesiegel,30 January 2020,9,"""It's so metaphorical"" is what Kevin says when they show him Da-Song's paint, he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about, most critics of this movie say exactly that ""It's so metaphorical"" obviously Most know what you are talking about, when writing something about a movie I have to be 100% sure that I have understood.""It's so metaphorical"" This comment on this movie is quite fair and precise; Parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground, sometimes leaves it to the public's interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story, a clear example is the first time Kevin visits the Park house, the house is shown in a low-angle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character, the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful: the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way, as there are many examples throughout the film; the fight over the cell phone in the Park house looks like an animal fight, the shots in the Kim's house are closed and in the immense Park house they are open and wide, a lot of voyeuristic Hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo, the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film, something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs, are some simply steps over others. Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.Kim's family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won't be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes."
17,A black comedy on social inequality,CineMuseFilms,28 December 2019,8,"There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance."
18,"FUNNY, TURNS SUDDENLY TWISTED, THEN SAD",jmholmes-73727,4 November 2019,10,"This movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become. Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families, one very poor, the other very rich. How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half; then, in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread - and perhaps even enjoy. Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.
If you see only one foreign language film this year, this should be it. Exciting and provocative throughout, it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury, while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away. Deserves all the accolades it has already - and surely will continue - to receive."
19,Whose the parasite and whose the cow?!,dougal79,17 August 2019,9,"What an amazing film! Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here.They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and the upper class.
You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too!
There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an ""idyllic"" past where Native American culture was relatively classless?Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!"
20,"unpredictable, eerie and with original horror plot",davyu-73849,18 January 2020,8,"Nowadays, the horror movies seem to be just about blood, gores, and fear-inducing trite. Parasite is breaking the mold in this category as well as in the realm of Hollywood. The synopsis won't be needed as you need to see it for yourself, and for your own good. The fact that Hollywood has already adapted its plot and is currently in the works with the help of its director proves its ingenuity."
21,Thought It Might Win Best Foreign Movie,boblipton,9 December 2021,10,"When the buddy who got into college tells him he's moving to the US, and he's passing on the 14-year-old he's been tutoring -- just tell 'em you're enrolled in college, even though you aren't -- the son of a family so low class they've sunk through the foundation finds them very nice, very accepting, and very clueless. So he and his layabout family get all the help fired; his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister, the father as the new chauffeur, and the mother as the cook/housekeeper. Yet even though you don't see them, there are vermin living in the foundations, and they come out when the people in charge aren't around.It's a movie that starts out as a situation comedy and then abruptly changes gears into horror, with a script that handles the theme of the people we don't see because they're not our problem in a way that jostles the boundaries of symbolic and mimetic fiction in a very disturbing fashion. When I saw it in a theater during its New York run, I was impressed. I was convinced it would be nominated for Best Foreign Movie, and might even win!"
22,simple opinion without any spoilers,Haneenho,10 April 2020,6,"1.This movie is too over rated, I don't know, maybe it is something wrong with me because so many people appreciates this film superlatively...2. All the characters are pathetically unlikable. They only show flaws. You don't want to be them; you don't want to be with them ... not at the beginning, nor in the middle, nor in the end.3. This lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.4. I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately."
23,Nonsense,jonaswilmann,16 February 2020,3,"A veteran chauffeur, his wife and their kid wonders, one fluent in English, the other an art wiz with expert computer skills and mastermind deception skills, are all unemployed (!) and lives in a scummy basement, where they fold pizza boxes for peanuts. With wildly implausible easy they con a rich family (ridiculous caricatures of rich people who apparently got rich by being soooo stupid) into employing them. First the son, then the sister, then the father ... you get it ... sleep-inducing snail's pace to the predictable setup where the entire family has leeched their way into the rich people's home. Once inside the home, the rich family goes on a vacation, and the poor family literally start ripping the home apart in a stupid drunken frenzy?? The old housekeeper (which they got rid of in a horrible way, causing a dangerous allergic reaction) shows up, and for some reason they let her in?? Turns out the old housekeeper is keeping her husband in a hidden basement under the house, where he has been living for four years (best explanation to why is that he is hiding from loan sharks). He has been flickering the lights morse code-style which the small boy of the house has deciphered (but he never tells anyone and it is therefore utterly pointless). Each family now knows each other's secret, so they are in a stalemate. Right? Movie apparently forgets this, an instead we end up with a big fight. A lot of nonsense. A flood. Then a lot more violence. Poor father kills wealthy father (because of his arrogance towards the poor which have a certain odor), then leaves his own two wounded children to die, running to hide in the basement (he would actually have to step over his son, who lies half dead in an enormous puddle of blood in order to get to the basement, but I think the director forgot this - add it to the five million other plot holes!). At some point near the ending - where the movie takes another tonal shift towards the sentimental - I realized that we are actually supposed to sympathize with the poor family, despite how EVIl they have acted the entire movie ... This movie is wildly implausible, first half wildly predictable, full of weird tonal changes and plot holes. Everything is overly constructed to underline some muddled point about social inequality, but nothing really makes sense. I loved ""Snowpiercer"" but this is total crap."
24,Great,0U,4 February 2020,No rating,The most original film of 2019 and it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie in quite a while. Class warfare at its best.
25,Totally Unique,Hitchcoc,7 August 2020,9,"Usually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including ""how"" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future."
26,The Korean house of social classes,mazzobr,1 December 2019,10,"When a smart South Korea poor family decides to escalate the social ladder and take advantage of a rich family offering it suited services to their familiar problems firstly they have to displace the former employees. They did not realize nor the family living in the house that in the underground of it there was an atomic bunker. I was built to face any attack from North Korea. The brokers didn't say that to their clients to maintain the market price. Later on, the new employees well established in the house will find out that part of the replaced employees' family lives in this secret basement. The film displays the South Korea class conflicts as a metaphor for growing poverty engulfing the population with rampant disemployment. In this fantastic realism film, all social classes are placed in the same house: poor, middle class and rich. Old resentments and prejudices escalate as time passes. A revolution, interests conciliation or a violent upheaval without winners may develop as those class representatives have to negotiate when and how to enjoy this gorgeous house built by a famous Korean architect. This is a masterpiece."
27,Oh Lucy!,JRConsidine,8 February 2020,8,"The film starts off as a Lucille Ball/Vivian Vance escapade and ends as Quentin Tarantino drama. I guess that's what we call fluidity.
Parasite is terrific. The cast is embraceable. The actors were recognized by the Screen Actor's Guild for the ""Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture."" Hurray for Parasite."
28,Plato Would have Loved,tgrafflin,22 January 2020,10,"I spent some time with the movie ""Parasite"" tonight. It captured me in it's symbiotic web. I'm sure there is not a single adjective that could describe it adequately...so I won't attempt that magficent accomplishment. Parasite tugged on every ounce of my acquired knowledge in philosophy, literature and Korean (yes...I do have a very tiny bit of that :) ) The set design was amazing...and it may give 1917 a run for it's money.The stairs...oh so thoroughly magnificent in the simplicity yet the most complex of ""metaphors"" (yeah, I made myself giggle on that one.) I was instantly reminiscent of my Philosophy 101 ""Allegory of the Cave""....""I went down."" Thank you Herr Hanak.Okay, I've lost all of you, I loved this movie for the Best Foreign Film...mostly because my theater neighbors tonight ate every kind of snack bar food possible...I will have nightmares about the gnawing, they chatted and checked their phones throughout...then they pottied and were able to read the screen....and then they seemed confused. Wonder why.My feeling about awards..knowing the methodolgy of the voting....this film will not be best picture on Oscar night."
29,"All-encompasing, unpredictable, engaging",bradyoconnell,20 January 2020,10,This movie had it all. The premise was so strange and unique. I never knew what was going to happen next. It touched on important issues around class and family. Overall just excellent. One of the few movies that deserves 10 stars
30,A sharp social commentary wrapped in thrilling drama,Falko_h1,27 May 2024,7,"""Parasite,"" directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a masterful blend of dark comedy, social commentary, and thrilling drama. The film follows the impoverished Kim family as they con their way into working for the wealthy Park family, leading to unexpected and shocking consequences.The film's greatest strength lies in its storytelling. Bong Joon-ho skillfully balances humor and tension, keeping the audience engaged and on edge throughout. The screenplay is sharp and layered, offering biting commentary on class disparity and social inequality without being preachy.The performances are stellar across the board. Song Kang-ho, as the Kim family patriarch, delivers a nuanced performance, while the rest of the cast, including Choi Woo-shik and Park So-dam, bring depth and authenticity to their roles.Visually, ""Parasite"" is stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in its production design. The contrast between the Kims' cramped basement home and the Parks' luxurious mansion is striking and symbolic.However, some viewers might find the film's tonal shifts jarring, and its ending, while impactful, may not satisfy everyone. Despite these minor issues, ""Parasite"" is a thought-provoking and well-crafted film that leaves a lasting impression. It's a unique cinematic experience that challenges and entertains in equal measure."
31,You know is Korean movie when something like this happen.,pavlomir,16 January 2020,8,"From my exposure to Korean Drama/Horror I know that something at some point will go horribly wrong and the end there is no happy end for nobody. And yet this was so unexpected when I watch this movie. Great drama, 8/10."
32,"A difficult film to digest, but a worth reflecting.",boss-981-447297,2 June 2024,7,"Reviewing this movie is a unique challenge for me. As a Japanese person, I've always had a special connection to Asian cinema, even if I haven't always been a fan of the style. My interest in Korean and Japanese movies is often driven by nostalgia rather than a refined taste for the acting and directing styles. It's not that these movies are bad, it's just that my preferences lean elsewhere.However, there are exceptions. One Korean movie that truly left a mark on me is Oldboy. If you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to skip the Hollywood remake and dive straight into the original. This movie is a visceral experience that will leave you reeling.The same feeling applies to Parasite. Again, I need to become more familiar with the director and actors. I went to the theater to watch this mainly because of the many praises, awards, and the surprising Oscar nomination for both the Best International Movie and Best Movie categories. Of course, I had to check it out.When I first sat down to watch Parasite, I had no idea what to expect. The movie starts off like a slice-of-life soap opera, a slow burner that gradually builds tension. But as the story unfolds, the tension escalates, leading to a gripping climax that will keep you on the edge of your seat.I can't speak too much, not to spoil the surprises and twists. And, oh boy, there are many twists to this plot. It's best to avoid reading anything about the story so you are surprised.Overall, the directing is superb. The screenplay is not complicated, and it's very well written. The acting is also competent, mixing moments of comedy and tension very well. But, it feels ""dry,"" if it makes any sense.This is definitely only a movie for some. And as I have minimal exposition to Korean filmmaking, I don't have many other references than Oldboy (and the rest of the Vengeance Trilogy movies, which I'm not too fond of so much). But Oldboy has such a visceral punch that it's hard to forget, even years after I watched it.Parasite lacks this punch even though the kind of storytelling is similar in a way: a tragedy. Don't get me wrong; it's a very good movie to go see in the theaters. But IMHO, I don't know why this movie is Oscar material. Alas, yes, there are several other nominees, but I also don't understand why they are Oscar material.From another perspective, for most of the movie, it reminded me of a Tarantino movie. Again, it still needs the punch. But it's textbook Tarantino through and through. The 2nd half is particularly striking and goes super deep into total madness. That's why you want to go to the theater to watch.I gave Oldboy a very solid 8 out of 10, and I highly recommend you watch it. Parasite is a bit behind, and I think it deserves a solid 7 out of 10."
33,"Not that deep, severely overrated",aguilar-85009,27 February 2020,5,"There are a few suspenseful scenes and a decent plot, along with comedic dialogue, but that's it. It's not a ""metaphorical masterpiece"" that some critics and users are saying. I feel as though too many people are trying to be expert critics like on that episode of South Park where the entire town writes crazy yelp reviews for all the restaurants."
34,Masterpiece,estrangeddd,6 December 2019,10,"Just wow! Not an easy watch, that's for sure, but I LOVED every moment of it. The actors were exceptional, the directing and writing was outstanding, not to mention all the fantastic metaphors that this movie was built on. What I really liked is that there is no ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" in this story. The one you feel sorry for, later you can get really angry at, and the other that you don't like at first, you can feel for them somehow in the end - at least I did. I didn't expect a lot of things that happened in this movie and the surprises were all great. Altogether for me, this movie is like a dark but true and beautiful poem. I was in my thoughts because of it for 2 days straight, couldn't get it out of my head. I could talk about it and all the problems in life it shed a light on, for hours afterwards. Absolutely a must watch!"
35,BEST MOVIE OF 2019!!,tatbtsisb,7 January 2020,10,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is well casted and acted, the cinematography was very well done. The themes are thought provoking. But the greatest thing about this movie is how much love, effort and dedication went into this. This movie has every genre in it, yet it doesn't feel too cramped. It might be unrealistic and some parts but the story was so amazing. The little details in this movie is what makes it a modern day masterpiece.Parasite is one of those movies that you will never forget and rewatch it over and over again. It is such a fine experience watching this movie, and everything is perfect about it. 10/10"
36,Here again- After BEST PICTURE,Parkiing,24 November 2019,10,"This movie reminds me of Life is Beautiful in its life hacks
very subtly written, amazing comedia
I am sure it will win Best Foreign Picture at the Oscars
And it deserves more than this
Best Korean movie ever made!
----------I went crazy when it won, it's masterpiece that will stay forever, and Bong Joon Ho will be a Korean idol"
37,No wonder this gem got almost 10 mins standing ovation at Cannes.,arisnaldonald,27 June 2019,10,"Oh man, what can I say...
How do I describe this jaw-dropping masterpiece in just few sentences?PARASITE (not mistaken with that outstanding anime 'Parasyte') is a socially conscious themed film that masterfully wrapped in comedy and thriller. It's an exciting and surprising ride from start to finish. The tone shifting in the second part of the film is done brilliantly. Eventhough there's so much stuff happening, Bong didn't lose control of his storytelling.Most of the scenes are sure very relatable for many in real life. On top of that, the ensemble cast (featuring my favorite Song Kang Ho) deliver a top notch Oscar-worthy performance.PARASITE is the worthy winner of this year Palme d'Or (and I also hope it will do well at the Oscar - Best Picture worthy? for sure!)It's the best film of the year, one of the best I've seen in this decade and for me it's arguably one of all time classic."
38,Why people should watch foreign films!,alicej-13706,12 January 2020,8,"The movie Parasite is one of the many films that reinforce why people should give up this ridiculous thing of not watching foreign films. People are so scared of subtitles that they are missing out on some of the best films ever made. After 5 minutes of subtitles you get used to it and don't even realise you're reading.Anyway back to this movie. Parasite is a fantastic film that really has no set genre as you will experience a drama, thriller, romance and horror all in one! Unlike most films you actually can sympathise with 99% of the characters even if they are seen as more of a villain. I wont give anything away but I will say that Parasite is a must watch and one of the best movies of 2019!"
39,"Class struggle. After Karl Marx and Victor Hugo, here is Joon-ho Bong",FrenchEddieFelson,9 June 2019,No rating,"This cinematographic gem has been recently rewarded by the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival. If I have one and only one advice to give you: go savor this fabulous movie with a strict minimum of information! Indeed, this film might schematically be split in two parts, the second one being quite surprising and unpredictable. The script is excellent and the casting is globally sumptuous, especially the gorgeousCho Yeo-jeongfor whom I may confess I have a crush.As a postscript, an anecdote certainly insignificant but literally astonishing when you're French: in the middle of the film, the proletarian family gives itself up to an orgy, the coffee table being covered with manifold dishes including two French cheeses as industrial as cheap: « Le rustique » and « Bresse bleu ». Unbelievable!"
40,Perfect film,raranoff,28 December 2019,10,"This film contains everything you want in a movie. Characters who are complex - not all good or all bad, interesting homes, humor, suspense, surprise, sex and depth. I was on the edge of my seat for much of the movie. It's the best movie I've seen all year."
41,Enjoyable but not a classic,Pidge_uk,9 October 2021,7,"The start and end felt rushed, but the film was generally enjoyable. Not sure why it was hyped quite so much, but definitely worth a watch, but it's unlikely to be a film I return to watch again."
42,"Parasite, a spoiler filled discussion",FelixisaJerk,12 November 2019,10,"Parasite
Hollywood Theater
11/11/19I've seen Parasite three times in five days. I think something may be wrong with me. It's just so good, even after repeat viewings the high-tension scenes still hold so many thrills. Bong Joon-ho has made a perfect film. I've seen it so many times I've memorized the characters lines so I can watch them almost the entire time without having to read the subtitles, this made the movie even more enjoyable. I just wanted to write some aimless thoughts about the movie, pretty much conversing with myself here, but feel free to read. Oh, and we definitely get to major spoilers so avoid this if you haven't seen the movie.Yeo-jeong Jo, the performer who plays Mrs. Park is such a gem. Her hysteria and earnest simplicity make her a joy to watch. Her face is so expressive and bright, there is a scene where she is walking up a flight of stairs and is witnessing her maid have a pretty disgusting coughing fit and the look of sheer disgust and revulsion on her face is so hilarious. She is the introductory cornerstone to the relatability and identifiable nature of the ultra-rich Park family.My favorite character is still Mr. Kim played by regular Bong hitter Kang-ho Song. The way Bong directs his performers seems to be relaxed as he's said Song would do multiple takes and each performance would be wildly different until he settled into what they felt was right. This proved to be a real challenge for editor Jinmo Yang, who would have to composite different takes into each other to make them work. For example, Song may have had an over the top take, but Jo may have had her best take of that same scene. Yang would digitally edit the scene to meld them and get the best performances from both actors. It's seamless to us, but to Yang that's a lot of pressure. Personally, this was cool to learn because we recently had to do this on a short film I worked on, good to know larger productions do this too. It's fascinating to watch Parasite with that in mind because Song's Mr. Kim is such an eccentric character and watching the other actors react to him is a treat. He's the least predictable of the entire family and seeing his various reactions and how he absorbs what's going on around him is captivating. During this screening I really took in his expressions and his motives for the actions he takes at the end of the film. They really clicked and made sense to me this time around. The way Song processes pain in his face is deftly subtle and minute.That pain we see paints a much larger dark mark across the underlying themes of the film. The title Parasite doesn't take a genius to decode. The poverty-stricken Kim family is very much in a symbiosis with the Parks. The Kims are driving them around, tutoring their children, cleaning their house and cooking their meals while Mr. Park's salary alone pays all four members of the Kim family. Which is insane to think about, that distribution of wealth is ridiculous. There is a line from Mrs. Kim, she says Mrs. Park is nice because she is rich, and how if she were rich, she would be nice too. She also likens money to an iron, smoothing out the creases. Which is an apt analogy, sure we all have heard money cannot buy happiness and images of the sad billionaire conjure up in our minds. We can say that money doesn't buy happiness, but money does buy us breathing room, it sands the sharp edge of reality down. When you're broke and down and out, everything seems like a threat. It seems like one strong wind, or in the case of Parasite, one literal storm can obliterate any stability you might start to create or what little you had to begin with anyways.A beautiful, heavy rainstorm is admired from the top of the hill where the Parks live, only to completely flood and destroy the semi-basement where the Kim's live. All that gorgeous rainwater flows downhill from the mansions and directly into the slums, consuming the entire Kim apartment. The next morning in the car Mrs. Park is mindlessly chatting away on the phone saying how much of a blessing the rain was and how clean everything is, she also takes notice of her driver, Mr. Kim's, unpleasant smell. Unbeknownst to her, 8 hours previously he and his children were neck deep in flood water mixed with raw sewage trying to salvage family photographs and prized possessions, all of which fit in a single box. The most striking shot in the film is Mr. Kim's daughter calmly smoking a cigarette, perched on top of a toilet violently spewing black filth. Cut back to the luxury Mercedes, Mrs. Park rides in, pinching her nose and rolling down a window, only for Mr. Kim to almost lose it. His face deftly registers exhaustion, anger, jealousy, and pain, the emotions revolve around his face like clockwork. Parasite messes with perspectives of reality and how your wealth measures how close to reality you really are. Mrs. Park isn't a villain, her wealth just acts as a warm, protective blanket of ignorance to the suffering around her.The tragic comedy and irony of Parasite goes even deeper. As the ending events of the film lead to Ki-taek (Mr. Kim) going into hiding, while his son Ki-woo, and wife have both now caught legal reps. Ki-woo writes a letter his father will never receive. He vows to buy the mansion his father is hiding out in. The bitter reality has me asking what kind of opportunities will a person with no formal education, no trained skills, and a criminal record have? What shot will this kid get? The friends who joined me at the screening were hopeful for Ki-woo's future, I however was not as optimistic. Yet the most compelling element of Parasite is that with the world it creates we really don't know what the future may have in store for the Kim family. It's a self-contained, grounded yet fascinating and strange universe we get to inhabit for a two-hour segment, and a world I will continue to revisit many more times."
43,"Ok film, but that's all. Overrated for sure.",matthew-41243,7 January 2020,6,"The film is ok but that's as far as I go. It's worth a watch but only a score of 6 for me. It's not a masterpiece, it's not film of the decade it's not even film of the year. I don't understand how people can give it 10, 10 is a perfect score. 10 is unachievable in my opinion as nothing is perfect."
44,The only horror about this film...,genosypheus,7 January 2020,5,"Is the fact that people who voted for it to win the Cannes film festival award and those who gave it anything higher than a 7/10 on this platform, actually exist.A family living below the poverty line in a 1st world nation whose kids couldn't pass the national exams or fold a pizza box would suddenly become world class con artistes overnight infiltrating a wealthy family? And when things took a dark turn, we the audience are supposed to feel sorry for them, just because they are poor, nevermind their greed, pride and total lack of character?Please don't insult our intelligence, at least 1 out of 3 accounts here are real and still give honest review."
45,Deep Movie,jonesaby,5 February 2020,8,"To be frank on my first watch I didn't feel much great about the movie... But then I read, watched some videos and now I enjoy the movie very much... It's an artistic beauty... I guess for usual audience (like me) it's just an okay movie but we need to dig this movie deeper to enjoy it completely"
46,Objectionable,federovsky,10 February 2020,No rating,"How has this film has won the best film Oscar? What a travesty. It's inane, rebarbative, empty, childish, overlong, silly, dull, cluttered and generally irritating. The social message, presuming there is one, is garbled, superficial and hollow. Everything is over-exaggerated to mind-numbing effect. How easily pleased all the people raving about this film are.There's a dude in the secret basement flashing morse code messages every day on a light upstairs. It doesn't occur to anyone to fix the light. That's just one example of the intellectual level of the utter narrative drivel that we are subjected to here. It would take me too long to go into all the others.It's bad enough that the Academy should be leaping on the 'it's different so it's great' bandwagon. I'm just afraid that the new social idiocracy that we now live in means that we will be subjected to this kind of clueless, jejune fantasy-comedy-horror melange for the next few years."

Hollywood Theater
11/09/19Disclaimer, this review is in two parts. Part One will have zero discussion of plot points and contain zero spoilers. Part Two will delve deeper into the film itself, so read part 2 only if you're cool with mild plot spoilers or have seen the film. With that out of the way:Part One:Parasite is no misnomer. It fully lives up to its title, as this film has taken over my brain and infiltrated my thoughts. Parasite has burrowed deep into my cerebrum and has interrupted my normal thinking capacities. I can't go a few minutes without remembering of some image, joke, line, or scene from the film. My self-diagnosis is apt and I fear I may be terminal.I think the best way to go into this film is to go how I went, totally blind. I've been looking forward to Parasite well before it took the Palme D'Or at Canne this year. Bong Joon-ho and crew have made an absolute masterpiece. A devilishly wild, pitch-black comedy, very much domesticated and between two families. I'll leave it at that and will not dive into the plot or story. Just know this film is in Korean so it is subtitled. It loses nothing in translation but I really wish I knew how to speak Korean so I could better relate to the natural flow of dialogue.The story is incredibly unique and builds astonishing tension that still has you holding your breath as it unfurls. Parasite pulls you in deeper and deeper, like quicksand, before too long you're in too deep. The editing is so feverish and well put together the 2 hour plus run time soars by. It feels modern, sleek, and gives me great hope for the future of filmmaking and leaves me with an even deeper respect for film made abroad.It's worth traveling to see, with Joker in every single theater in the country it hurts my little liberal arts heart that Parasite will likely not make its way outside of larger cities. My podunk friends, I apologize, you'll have to wait for a digital or physical release, likely around the end of the year. Lucky for you ""Terminator: Dark Fate,"" and John Cena's new firehouse dog movie ""Playing with Fire,"" will keep you company while you wait.Part Two: Where we actually talk about stuff, here be potential spoilers, ye' ave' been warnd' (sorry I am still processing The Lighthouse)Parasite is astonishing on an emotional level. It's a spiderweb of high tension thrills, hidden identities and masterfully curated small details. We meet the Kim family. Dirt poor, living in the basement level of a towering overcrowded building. Their lives are a struggle, phones turned off, internet turned off, it's an eye-opening depiction of poverty in 2019. The entire family (mother, father and two 'twentysomething' kids) is out of legitimate work, to help make some semblance of ends meet the entire family folds frozen pizza boxes for a young entrepreneur.
When a fortuitous opportunity arises for Ki-Woo (their son) to tutor the daughter of the ultra rich, affluent Park family, he finds a way to get each member of his family working for the Parks. It starts slowly, as his sister Ki-Jung acts an art therapist to young Da-Song, his father becomes Mr. Parks driver and his mother takes the place of the previous housekeeper.Typing that all out is simple enough, but none of these people are what they say they are. And the theatrical scams put in place to get the Kim family into the house are increasingly risky and hilarious. Ki-Woo (played by Woo-sik Choi) failed his college entry exam 4 times, his sister Ki-Jung (played by So-dam Park) is a true con artist, she literally Googled art therapy and ad-libbed everything else, his mom Chung-Sook (played by an awesome Hyae Din Chang), a physically intimidating champion shot putter is absolutely not a high end housekeeper, but most fraudulent of them all is dad, Ki-taek played by regular Bong Joon-ho collaborator Song Kang-Ho. I love this man. I love this actor. I love this character. He's totally pathetic, physically weak, he seemingly has no real skills. What is evident about his character is he truly loves his family. Seeing his face light up and beam with pride when his kids commit these scams is actually heartfelt and touching.I quickly fell in love with these characters as if they were my own family. You might get the misconception that the Park family might be rich, snobby, rude people but they really aren't. That's something I respect about Parasite, there aren't any clear cut villains or heroes. It's not that kind of story. It's so grounded in reality. Director and writer Bong Joon-ho apparently started getting this idea when he was an actual college tutor, in a luxurious house in which he didn't belong. He started thinking about how funny it would be to have his friends working in this house too.What really grips me with Parasite is how the movie utilizes senses. It's visually stunning, the architecture of the Park mansion contrasted with the shabby half basement the Kims live in, the way light, darkness and color is used, but maybe the most impressive is how much smell comes into play. You can't smell movies, but somehow Parasite has smells. Smell becomes a large part of the film. It's hard to explain but if you've seen Parasite you'll get what I am talking about.Bong Joon-ho has created something truly mesmerizing and thrilling. I do not have a single critique of the film. It's absolutely flawless and leaves a taste in your mouth long after viewing. I was absolutely convinced Quentin Tarantino's: ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" was the best film of the year but Parasite may have stolen my vote, or maybe that's exactly what the little bug in my brain wants me to say. See it as soon as possible."
48,A cordial invitation to welcome this Parasite gem in the 21st century full of remakes and reboots.,iamianiman,9 August 2019,8,"Following the step of Get Out, it is a powerful film that comprises of metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout. No worries, you will understand the film even if you fail to unlock the codes unlike Mother! & Us.Parasite welcomes the audience into multi-genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act. Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy dramas, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. The director, Bong Joon-Ho wonderfully converts them smoothly without letting the audience feels bizarre of the transformation.With merely 10 characters into play, Parasite brilliantly executes layer after layer of interesting character developments which progresses the plot forward to ultimately produce a comprehensive film.Parasite professionally handles cinematic tricks to synchronize every possible element for the greater good such as excellent use of cinematography techniques with superb artistic values, information-packed dialogues, lavish architecture production designs & vibrant colours.Quite certain scenes feel a little too long and weary. If they can cut short and add new scenes instead, the pacing will be better and more entertaining.Majestic musical set pieces is utilized in the background to help produce a richer tone to the distinct elements.The suspenseful moments would have you at the edge of your seat without noticing until the point you recall your experience inside the hall.Verdict: A strongly crafted masterpiece film on social themes and satire that finds its place in audience's heart.In short, it is one of those episodes of Black Mirror."
49,Watch the movie it speaks for itself!,danielj-521-351057,22 January 2020,9,"Well what can I say, Boong Joon-Ho is truly delivering here a masterpiece of cinema screenwriting and directing. This is an interesting, humorous and intense experience surely not to miss.You forget this is even a Korean film as you get vacuumed into a world of it's own - you won't be disappointed!!"
50,An amazing movie,Ami65,7 February 2020,8,"Parasite is an exceptional, innovative and unforgettable movie in expression and form. Movie music is quite fit and suitable in every scene. It elaborates the dark side of social disparity masterfully. I have not seen such an intense and impressive movie for a long time."
51,Who the Parasite really was:,eoghanorourke-00011,9 February 2020,8,"We find the prosperous Park family to be the occupants of a slick, scando-sheek home in Seoul, Korea.
Mr Park is a fantastic provider for his family; in quintessential Korean fashion; as a tech entrepreneur. His wife and two children seem not to be in want of anymore than they already have. Despite this, his family are precariously vulnerable to social exploitation. His youngest son, who 'saw a ghost', is now subject to seizures. His daughter is a hopeless English language student who only sees her tutor classes as an opportunity to get a boyfriend. Finally his wife is highly impressionable and not fully competent to tackle the issues of her two children.
In addition to whatever jobs he has created at work, Mr Park employers a driver, housemaid and English tutor for himself, his daughter and his wife respectively. All of these seem to be happy in their employment.The Kims are another family of four but, for reasons we are not sure of, live in very basic accommodation in a poor part of the city. None of the family have solid jobs but it is not explained whether this is due to fecklessness or sheer bad luck despite best efforts. Lack of ability seems unlikely in their case as we see that they are very clever, albeit in a Machiavellian way. For example, they are happier to trick their way into getting paid for doing a bad job then actually folding the pizza boxes correctly.The English tutor at the Parks home recommends to the son of the Kims to temporarily replace him as tutor to the daughter of the Parks on the one condition that he leaves her alone for him to ask out when he returns.
This soon snowballs into all members of the Kim family shamelessly exploiting the Park family and their employees.
Their crimes are as follows:Forging an official university document and using it to gain employment.Exploiting and encouraging the mis-diagnosed mental illness of a young boy.Getting two people fired by destroying their reputations.Stealing food and alcohol.Murdering Mr Park because he didn't like the smell of a man who:Lived underground for 4 yearsHad a barbecue sword of meat sticking out of himWas deadThe Parks weren't perfect but nowhere did they claim to be. What they were was a respectable family who contributed to society in a positive manner.
The Kims were a clever but immoral family who continually made bad decisions at key moments, bringing their downfall on themselves.Unfortunately the parasite was so entrenched that once its downfall became the downfall of the host."
52,"My God People, Really?? Get Your heads out of the sand",bp29,8 February 2020,6,"After reading all the glowing reviews, especially about how this film is one of the best of the decade I had to see it for myself- the plot it self wasn't anything ground breaking, and while the technical aspect of the film were flawless and i enjoyed it for the first hour, the ending was a total let down (lots of plot holes that I won't get into here) I agree with some other reviewers, the Park family weren't your typical rich snobs, the father worked for his money and came home home and was always there for his children and polite to the domestics, the problem was the family was just too darn naive and foolish, but not terrible people by any means, all in all just a mixed bag, Shoplifters was a much more engaging and heart felt piece of foreign cinema, and I highly recommend watching that!!"
53,Thy shall not ridicule fellas with body odor. Definitely deserves the best picture award.,Fella_shibby,4 February 2020,10,"Finally saw this much talked about film. As a fan of Korean thrillers, this film surpassed my expectations.
The film is about a poor family who cleverly n cunningly become employed by a wealthy couple, posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.The film begins like a dark satire, it then proceeds into a captivating thriller n ends like a surreal crime.The film is very entertaining inspite of the sad stuff shown about poor fellas but mind u, it is not at all demeaning. It is very gripping n weirdly hilarious."
54,good movie but i couldn't understand how it won the best picture,dvdboss-2,15 March 2020,7,I watched this movie. it's a good movie but i couldn't understand how it won the best picture. i think this movie doesn't deserve that for sure.
55,Come on people...,michael_woodley,7 January 2020,4,"This is not about social inequality. This is about a bunch of con artists who take advantage of a naive wealthy family. Its story is convoluted, far too long, and people are grasping to find depth. I've already wasted too much time on this so I'm not writing anything further."
56,A masterpiece directed by a true genius,livtyler79,11 January 2020,10,"I'm just wowed by the film. It's an entertaining arthouse film that let audiences experience a variety of kinds of emotions during its screening.
This satirical dark thriller talks about a sensitive issue about our society faced with inequality of wealth and class warfare through a poor family infiltrating into a rich household in the manner of what the audiences can easily get the point. Not only does this film provide you with such a poignant messages about the current times we live in but also it worths as a crowd-pleaser.
Actually this film can't be referred as a specific genre in terms of its narrative and the plot that contain the elements of comedy, thriller and drama with the twists and turns. Bong again proves that he creates his own genre himself as just seen by many critics and cinephiles."
57,Don't have any expectations,luulally,18 August 2019,10,This movie surprises you by every new scene. I couldn't say what genre the movie is but it delivers a whole experience. I had no idea what the movie is about in the beginning but it is worth it. Shows perfectly in a dramatical and comedian way the differences between rich and poor
58,Amazing,victoriadastres,18 August 2019,10,Extreme! Definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a good criticism about the rich and poor in the world.. the movie is really interesting and pretty sad... worth it. Please watch it. You will not regret it.
59,Make any plan is an all-time joke.,efkostas,16 January 2020,9,"The film is a contemporary cinamatic adaptation of the Sisyphus myth. You will even find the stone, symbolically appearing at many scenes."
60,Best movie,royalsharon66,11 January 2020,10,"This Korean-language movie was such a contrast with the drivel Hollywood churns out. The story was great, the acting was great, and the director maintained tight control throughout. I must see more of Mr. Bong Joon Ho's work."
61,You will enjoy this movie,nessieclarks,22 January 2020,9,"Hilarious at times, weird, with some unexpected plot twists. Shows that whether you are rich or poor, the life you lead is really is just as futile........update: Yessss I am so happy that it has now won an oscar for best movie ! Well deserved!"
62,Not upto the hype,elangamban,20 March 2020,6,Movie is over rated. Its an average movie. Don't know why it created this much buzz.
63,Parasite (2019),whippan,9 February 2020,9,"Director Bong Joon-ho's global sensation, Parasite, is an allegorical tale of class warfare. Before watching the film, I was familiar with its high praise but knew little of its actual plot. If possible, I'd recommend other viewers similarly go into this one as cold as they can. While Parasite deals with heavy themes (economic mobility, climate change), it does so in ways that are constantly entertaining and surprising. A unique blend of drama, suspense, comedy, and horror, Parasite provides further proof that cinema is a truly universal language."
64,Not good Not bad,junesunday-98515,25 May 2021,6,It was not that good and not that bad for me. It's quite boring in middle of the movie but at the end it was good.
65,totally overrated,ajikude,26 February 2020,5,Good but definitely not worth an Oscar for best movie or best director.
66,if you haven't seen it for the first time I envy you,sebastiantorrestodd,16 January 2020,10,"Delightful from beginning to end, opening is way in between genres, loved the pace, the comedy, the ending, the twist, the characters, pretty much everything.I'm just waiting to rewatch it and pick new details.if you do (watch it) please do it in the cinema and maybe you will get a crowd like mine that bonded trough the laughs and the shock and ended up talking about it outside.And If you end up thinking is overrated it's okey, but you will still end up thinking about it for days."
67,Amazing Screenplay,rupak-rghosh-ghosh19,17 January 2020,9,"Apart from the great cinematography what overwhelmed me about this movie is its screenplay.
The movie follows a continuity of speed and all the way keeps the humour intact. The dark satirical comedy which is funny but after every laugh it also pins a thought about the actual darkness which creates the humour and it lingers for sometime. A movie for all genre lovers."
68,The nuance of classism captured on film,spenserspratlin,13 January 2020,10,"In our current era of film, it is commonplace to take a moral stance. Whether that stance is on human struggles, political processes, or social conditioning, the stance prevails, and we as the audience have to make our decision while we watch the film on whether or not we agree with the points being brought to us. Films like Elysium, Little Women, 1917, these all wear their moral stance on their sleeve.Parasite does it differently. The film opens in a way that makes you think the morality of the film will be open and obvious for you, so that you don't have to think too hard about the minutia to feel confident in your morals while watching it. You think you know who to root for, and who is the ""bad guy"".As you keep watching, Parasite continually pushes your sense of morals, prodding you with the question ""how far is too far?"" and ""how bad is too bad?"". These questions never give you a break, never give you time to come to terms with your answer as Bong Joon Ho continually ramps up the tension until you feel as though your heart will stop in it's tracks.Parasite poses a moral stance with great nuance and care."
69,Absolute Brilliance,zhenwenho,10 January 2020,10,"It isn't every day that you come across a movie like this, a practically flawless one in my opinion actually. I have nothing but praise for director Bong Joon-Ho and I can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months. This is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive. Don't worry, this review won't have any spoilers whatsoever.To begin this praise train I have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor Choi Woo-shik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movie.Another standout would be Kang-Ho Song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by Bong Joon-Ho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities.A transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie. The pacing was consistently on point where everything, even the change in tone is seamless. Along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semi-basement house in the suburbs.Furthermore, another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by Jung Jae-il which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable. Through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone I shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie.The plot of this movie is something I've yet to see over the many years of watching movies and this is where praised should be absolutely given for this ambitious plot where I could simply say, nothing written and the direction of this movie which keeps you guessing as to what this movie really is about should you dive deeper than the way the movie was promoted within the trailers shown for it. It is nothing short of extraordinary as you are unable to really see the change in tone coming.At the end of the day, this movie questions how the rich could help the poor and in fact portrays mankind's strive for survival which in this case would be a better life in such a way that it isn't in your face. Plus, by the end of the movie, you really realise there is no real protagonist or antagonist, just people. People trying to live a happier life.Thus, making Parasite the perfect movie where I am unable to criticise a single thing in this movie. Director Bong Joon-Ho has definitely earned my trust in his artwork and should to some extent be placed amongst the greats."
70,Incredible.,Sleepin_Dragon,7 May 2020,10,"Possibly the best film I've seen for some time, yes I have a few lockdown blues, and needed something to cause a bit of escapism, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those films that's almost impossibility to classify, it doesn't really fit into any specific genre, but covers almost all of them.A great start, it holds your attention incredibly well, I enjoyed the latter stages as much as the first part of the film, I know some didn't. It just moves you into a totally different place.You'll laugh, and cry, you'll lose yourself in the wonder. Do yourself a favour and order it, 10/10."
71,"Funny, messed up, depressing, scary. All of these things describe Parasite.",TheCountVictor,2 December 2019,10,"I have seen two films previously from the director of this film, Bong Joon Ho. Those being Okja and The Host. I like them both quite a bit. I think however, that Parasite is the best film I have seen from him. Don't judge this movie on the US trailers, I felt they did a really bad job marketing the film, they made it look really pretentious. In reality, the actual movie isn't anything like that trailer. This is a dark, funny, insane, crazy, and thought provoking film.I won't get too much into the plot as I feel it's something you should experience for yourself but the film centers around this poor family, the Kims, who try and take advantage of a rich family, the Parks. Things get complicated from there.The acting in this movie is phenomenal, everyone here gives their A game. The directing by Bong Joon Ho is simply masterful. The screenplay is smart, creative, darkly funny like a Coen Bros movie (it reminded me a lot of Fargo especially), and is pure insanity at points. The film doesn't take sides on either family, they both do pretty bad things but at the same time, you surprisingly care about them, despite how flawed both of them are. The halfway point and the climax are some of the craziest moments I have seen all year. The movie also does a great job tackling the issues between classes in Korea.The cinematography is beautiful, especially those big wide shots of environments. The editing is exquisite, no scene goes on for too long, they make every second of this film matter, and I never felt bored by the film, the 2 hour and 12 minute runtime flew by for me. The music is also pretty good as well.Overall, Parasite is one film you absolutely must see this year. It has great performances, amazing direction, one of the best screenplays of the year, and it keeps you guessing what will happen next. Go into this movie as blind as you can, the less you know, the better."
72,"Good, but not wonderful.",natascha-zacharko,12 May 2023,6,"I had to leave a comment because I have no idea how this movie received an 8.5 rating. 6 range at best. As far as Korean masterpieces go I thought ""The Handmaiden"" and ""The Housemaid"" were far better stories about class. The script had tremendous ideas and I was looking forward to them ... and then they just dropped off and switched to a new plot. It felt very messy. There were scenes that had no follow up or no point. Like they had to fill a plot hole last minute. If hours of this film were cut, that would make sense. It felt like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a dark drama, or a dark comedy. If it wanted to be just a family friendly dark comedy, you went too far, if you wanted to be a intense drama, you really dropped the ball. It felt like the director wanted to appeal to a wider audience by playing it safe. The more I think about it, the less respect I seem to have for its ""artistic"" merrit. Absolutely Overrated.As I'm reading throught the miles of reviews, I'm convinced these are westerners who just started watching foreign films this year, or they're all paid. The common theme is people seem to think they are incredibly intelligent for having watched this. Another reviewer commented this is the SAME exact plot as ""Married with Children"" even down to Chicago, Illinois being a factor. Just blew my mind and now I have even less respect for the script."
73,Parasite!!!,dimatteophilip,22 January 2020,10,"With Parasite, director Bong Joon-Ho creates an fantastic piece of cinema, that never lost my attention once. This movie makes your think it is going to be one thing and then it becomes something totally new. It's fresh, it's clever, it's shocking and it's satisfying. There is a scene in this movie that concludes the first act in a way that can only be compared to watching a Tetris game where every piece falls into its perfect place one after the other. Around the middle point something is revealed to the Audience that totally changes the path the movie was going on and from there it's an unrelenting roller coaster ride. Bong Joon-Ho also writes some fantastic characters, each of them getting their own perfect moments to shine. Not one character seemed out of place or without reason. They all had their place and brought different layers to the story through their actions and ideas. The actors of course help in bring this characters to life amazingly and the entire cast kills it to the maximum degree! Parasite is a film wonder and must be seen by all."
74,"Fine, but Overrated.",euplay1220,4 March 2020,6,"This film doesn't allow easy reviewing because it has many aspects, many ways to look at. Is it thriller? Comedy? Drama? Societal critique? It's all of it; and therefore none of it. All in all, I was underwhelmed and mildly frustrated.The style is there, I grant it. Cinematography is great. Acting is awkward at some points, but it's OK because of the partially comedy-like nature of this film.But then, there is a problem with story telling. It builds up nicely toward the middle, where the parasites settle in their host and discover the secret down below. And then it makes an unexpected turn. It's alright to make a surprise at the end (I'd even say it's good), as long as it flows reasonably from the preceding story line. A reveal must make sense once it is revealed. This one didn't do the job convincingly for me. We are given very little clue about why people acted the way they did at the birthday party.This film is just fine, but no masterpiece in my opinion. Some films are so easy to understand to the point of being insulting; others are so obscure to the point of being pointless. Great films do it just right somewhere in this spectrum. Unfortunately, this one is leaning to the pointlessness."
75,The reviews are misleading,CroMarduk,8 January 2020,2,"Ludicrous movie. I can't understand the reviews. This movie is full of insane people acting completely illogical. The poor are lazy and threacharous, while the rich are naive and simple. Don't believe the hype."
76,Entertainment at it's best,gautamparag,19 January 2020,10,"I know a lot of people have skipped this..... because nobody wants to read subtitles for 2 hours. I hope you are reading this.... And I hope that you can shake off your earlier reservations.... Please watch this.... Movies like this are very rarely made nowadays. Doesn't matter what genre a person likes.....this has it all.... Comedy, Love, Family, Thriller, Crime, Horror. What an awesome movie !!!!"
77,"a treat for the eyes, I didn't have to think too much to give it a 10 ,",harindersandhuhs,11 October 2019,10,"You will watch it and you know it has subtleties
It talks about how poor and rich ""nice"" people see each other
It doesn't bore you for a single minute
It is the best this year"
78,A melody of fine cinema,shannondeanlim,24 January 2020,10,"Parasite is a melody of fine cinema. It hits all the right notes that attracts its audiences with just the right amount of everything it has to offer. Each sequence delivers the perfect pacing relative to the ongoing conflict, accompanied by beautiful cinematography and scoring. The cast delivers an engaging performance that brings a sense of true harmony with each other. It also combines all forms of genre really well without it being cramped or overbearing. It excels in nearly all creative and technical aspects, but what truly captivates its viewers is its masterful storytelling. Overall, Bong Joon-ho has crafted a beautifully dark and chilling story that transcends language and connects with millions. The film deserves all the praise that it gets not only for its impeccable storytelling but also for setting a greater standard in the cinematic landscape."
79,A film that manages to interrogate the choices every class makes while delivering a roller coaster of emotions for the audience,bijanadhikari,18 September 2019,10,"I will just say this first. If you are planning to watch this film, stop right here and watch it now before reading anything regarding this film because trust me you want to watch this without knowing anything not even the synonyms.Now, directed by Joon-ho Bong who also directed Memories of Murder and Snowpiercer, Parasite is a dark comedy thriller which mixes various other genre. Its really hard to describe this film. I would compare this with Quentin Taratino films like the title suggests. But even then this film has a lot of direct message to audience and themes which is very easy to notice. That aside Joon-ho Bong has also upped his game in terms of the structure and storytelling. So much so that at first viewing you won't notice the hidden details and metaphors this film presents. The name ""parasite"" is just one of them. At the end you will be thinking who the real parasites are. Is it the rich, the poor, their expendable need for a better living or the house itself? Acting wise I dint see a single false note by any actors. The main standout was of course the father played brilliantly by Kang-ho Song. Writing is however what makes this film so great. You can see when the director wrote this film he thought of everything. There is not a single loop hole. Every character choices make sense, everything falls into place even when it seems to bizarre yet it seems so completely realistic just because just how we got to that point.There is so much this film tries to say and you can see the director succeeded it gloriously when you think about it. The social structure with the way we live, our understanding and psychology at looking at people who live differently, our priorities and what we value. Joon-Ho Bong makes sure viewers will think after each act is completed and make your own judgement of what happened. He has completely turned a genre on its head. A film about social class has never been made like this before.Still, this film may not please to people who just want a happy ending feel good movie. Without spoiling anything till now I will say that the first half is completely different to the second half. If you are the type of person who can handle violence and shock in a film then I will recommend this for you. If you are the person who want something different and original other than what hollywood keeps throwing these days I will recommend this for you. If you think film are not just for entertainment but for the art itself I will recommend this for you. Film industry need to keep investing on visionary directors like Bong Zoon-Ho and you might just get a masterpiece like this once in a while."
80,Painting Social Criticism With a New Color,Mister_F11,22 January 2020,9,"For me, Parasite is most convincing because of its confusing story, which is especially convincing because of its untypical pattern, so that it's hard to tell which genre you just saw. The script remains clumsy and at least gives me an oppressive feeling at the end. Moreover, the film is very nice to watch because of the staging and because of the convincing acting and set design you can put yourself in the movie's shoes and put yourself in the shoes of the characters, which are all put on with a lot of love."
81,A Masterpiece/Work of art.,novacasa42,26 November 2019,10,"As I write this, I want to describe my raw initial state after I finished the film, I'm in a state of complete awe, staring into the wall kind of awe, Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece.
This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible.
Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You.
In all honesty, I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film, MINDBLOWING."
82,Lacks any realistic human dimension,howard.schumann,15 October 2019,7,"South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (""Okja"") says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way. Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the ""ranks and classes"" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film ""depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society."" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact.The film looks at class differences between two families - one well-to-do, and the other n'eer do well. For the Kim family, life is a struggle. They live in a cramped bug-infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf. The father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, ""Snowpiercer"") has failed in business and has accumulated many debts. His son and daughter Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik, ""Train to Busan"") and Ki-jung (Park So-dam, ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" TV series) have repeatedly failed college entrance exams. The mother Chung-sook (Hyae-jin Jang, ""Adulthood"") along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company, but cannot even get that right. Not to worry, they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi-Fi from the next door coffee shop.On the other hand, the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages. Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun, ""Jo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage"") is the CEO of a high-tech company and the family lives in a spacious, modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls. He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong, ""The Target""), a teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so, ""The Tiger""), and a hyper-active young son Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude, for Bong, they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters. With the aid of a friend, Ki-woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da-hye. Of course, he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs. Park of his competence. With that conquest out of the way, the cunning Ki-woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family.Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso, Mrs. Park hires Ki-jung as an art teacher, then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims, this time for the deadbeat dad Ki-taek and his wife Chung-sook. Bong said that ""Sometimes with the characters in my films, I look at them cynically, but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters, even with the villains."" This compassion, however, does not seem to extend to the loyal, hardworking household workers, their work scammed out of existence. Without going into detail, the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over-the-top unsettling even though utterly implausible.Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy, a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers, revenge, bloody violence, a torrential rainstorm, people hiding under beds, and any other mayhem that may come to mind. To be clear, Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp-edged, yet it is hardly, as one critic described it, ""a masterful dissection of social inequality."" When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film, Bong said, ""I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about. It is in parts funny, frightening, and sad, and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it, I'll wish for nothing more."" Enjoy the drink. In a little while, you may have trouble remembering what the film was about."
83,A masterpiece,aya_saadoon,9 January 2020,10,"Such a masterpiece that saved us from a big disappointment of 2019 movies, parasite is definitely the best of the year"
84,Learn to think for yourself.,davidqvist,8 January 2020,6,"There are lots of great movies out there. This is just not one of them. Why? Because it's predictable to a degree that I have seldom experienced. All major events can be predicted way ahead of them happening, which makes watching this movie into nothing but a waiting game. It's not deep and it's definitely not clever.If the director should ever reveal that he made this movie as an experiment to explore how hollow of a movie you can get away with and still have the world hyped, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised."
85,What a pathetic drama.,harshit001,3 April 2020,2,Maybe people get too emotional in West. May be that is why it got an Oscar. There's nothing special about this movie; the story so average.
86,Cinema at its best,seveneleven-44269,5 January 2020,10,"This is one of the greatest thing ever produced for a long time and most importantly ,Fresh. Unpredictable,mysterious and comedic so many feelings at the same time. Just watch and experience yourself if haven't already."
87,"What if you are a parasite, host or neither is...",joliana-08081,17 September 2019,10,"A question in my mind after watching this movie is if I'm one of these roles and what will I do?""Parasite"" presents the situation that the worst outcome might happened when the different social classes meet. The depiction of bottom-class people in this film are both sympathized but greedy. Although rich people are kind, they just can't stand the smell and life quality from bottom-class people, and they express their emotion too obviously to bottom-class people. This is humanity, and there is no correct answer, but we can think deeply in this issue. And what if you are neither parasite nor host, would you try to narrow the wealth gap or just be a bystander and do nothing?It's very meaningful that most people give more concerns and think about each other after seeing this film."
88,Spectacular movie,drunken_raindrops,7 December 2019,10,"This movie is just smart, entertaining, and artistically fulfilling. If it had only succeeded in one of those three aspects, this would be a very good movie, but instead it just excels at all three.The script is more than satisfying and highly entertaining. And the way the movie presents its own world and draws you in completely... it is just beautiful.It is difficult to judge the acting when you don't speak the language, but all interactions look very convincing and in line with the implausibility of this so ridiculous world, yet so similar to ours.I just wanted to write this review to recommend anyone who's reading to watch this movie. I really enjoyed it and, I will gladly watch it again some time in the future."
89,Just wow,JK-WhatsUpWeirdoPodcast,4 February 2020,10,"Glad I watched all the other best picture noms first because now I KNOW they all pale in comparison to this one ... I couldn't even move for like the last hour, and the last 20 minutes my hands were over my mouth and didn't drop once.A masterpiece."
90,AVOID ALL SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS!!,midorixo,24 January 2020,8,"So happy i managed to see this movie with NO IDEA what was to come, though the trailers were a strong indication of what was to come. I wish i didn't have to rely on subtitles, knowing there are many subtleties you miss with limited translation.
Ater some time for reflection, this movie reminds me of 'shoplifters,' another excellent movie that reflects on unconventional familial love."
91,"Daring, original, but doesn't quite hang together",bobyule,29 February 2020,6,"I've often thought that the genre mix of comedy - thriller is the most difficult to bring off. Somehow the two different kinds of reality, in their extremes, don't mix easily, unless the very nature of the narrative demands it, as in Dr Strangelove.The comic first half is somewhat slow, and deals with the infiltration of a wealthy but naïve family, by a streetwise poor one. However, when the action develops along more serious lines in the second half, the atmosphere created in the first half still carries a surreal edge, and so I couldn't believe in the subsequent action sufficiently to be thrilled or horrified.A brave attempt, but in the end I was left feeling a bit numb. It all seemed to lack any solid centre, with serious themes looking trivial, and comic themes looking disturbing rather than entertaining. All a bit tasteless, really."
92,Great movie and great director!!,vlada_stamenkovic,19 January 2020,9,"Recommendation for this great movie. Bitter comedy, which reflects today's society, through the prism of Korea."
93,Just read...,mgd_m,21 January 2020,No rating,"Parasite is a unique movie. I don't know if it's a true masterpiece, or one of a kind (indeed), or just a piece of masterful craft. Bong does everything he wants while telling his stories, and he's the only one I know who can do that aside from Tarantino. The plus here is a very sound moral. I will think a lot about Parasite, and maybe watch it again. This is the first time in 100+ reviews that I don't feel I can correctly rate a movie, but surely it is in the 8 to 10 stars range."
94,best 2019 movie????,vialactea,16 February 2020,7,"Good movie, interesting story line, but never in a million years could win a oscar for best movie of the year...Political decision for sure! that's the world we live in unfortunately."
95,What's more disgusting than actually being disgusting?,b_velkova,22 November 2019,1,"A family of incompetents who struggle to fold a pizza carton miraculously transform to ingenious con artists and infiltrate themselves into a rich home where they successfully pretend to deliver services they have no clue of. The inhabitants of the house, on the other hand, are so incredibly stupid that they don't notice anything is wrong except for some wierd smell. But the impostors refuse to be judged by their smell! A bloodbath follows. The end. Standing ovation at Cannes, Palme d'Or, 8,6-star rating on IMDB...
It's not just a bad story, no, it's actually the perfect story based on the wrong belief that if you are poor, you cannot be expected to be good, and if you are rich, you are never good enough. Naturally, stereotypical characters follow and I couldn't make myself care about any of them. The only moments when the poor father showed some deepness were during his monologue about living with no plans and when he checked his smell after he heard the rich father complaining about it. Otherwise, all family members were interested only in filling their bellies with junk and had no reservations in causing any kind of harm to that end. Now, I know I'm supposed to dislike the rich family, but although I didn't like them either, I don't see what's so wrong about them. But the urge in society to favor the have-nots, no matter what their actual traits might be, is so strong that most of the reviewers take their side, while some even find them ""lovable"". And that I find even more disgusting than actually being disgusting.Post Oscars Addition:
Technically Parasite is a great movie, no, really. But the Oscars are not about that. Nor it is why anybody watches movies. People are interested in stories and these awards are all about politics. Now, the fact that this movie won most of the major Oscars is not that surprising. Could be because it is a foreign movie, could be because it is a marxist movie, could be both, as far as they are both valid arguments for leftist Hollywood. What concerns me is that it looks like the whole world is praising it happening and I'm sure that most fans don't care about the art of storytelling or directing. I think they believe what Bong Joon-ho ultimately shows us: that nobody is deserving, that we are all a bunch of idiots, clashing in a stupid game for money. But think about that: someone did build the house where we all want to live in, right? And that must be someone with some knowledge, skills, and integrity, otherwise the roof would have collapsed, wouldn't it? Does everybody really find it fair to deny all this?"
96,Super original,xpunisherx,17 January 2020,9,It was between an 8 or 9 for me and the super originality and unique story was why I gave it a 9. The only con I had was it was a pretty creepy movie throughout and I had an ending playing out in my head that I thought was going to happen and thought it would be great. I was way off course. Which is also a great pro at the same time.
97,Good for me,chosalebmt,18 January 2020,9,"Like the title, the film is catchy and dramatic to the end"
98,Masterpiece,chaimamad,30 December 2019,10,"This movie just changed my whole opinion about what korean movies can do! It was excellent, surprising and it is going to steak in my mind for a very long time! One of the best movies of 2019 considering that i didn't watch all of them. Also this is my first review on imdb"
99,Great film!,kleinjeremy,17 November 2019,10,"Oh my goodness. This is one of the best films I've seen in a while. If you choose to see this film, I plead for you to go in blind. That's the best way to view it.I'm trying to not say anything about it here. If one person sees this review and decides not to look anything up before watching, then I'll have succeeded."
100,Glad this movie was recognized by the academy.,jeroboam-26661,8 February 2020,8,I don't watch many non-english language films but I think Parasite is worthy of worldwide recognition for being an exceptional film. Although I don't see it as a masterpiece I think there are a lot of high-level elements of filmmaking in this. The plot seems simple enough but there is a lot of depth in the writing and storytelling to warrant multiple viewings. The acting is great as well as the direction but I'm always feeling like I'm missing the full experience when subtitles don't convey the subtleties of the language and cultural references. But that just goes with the territory if you happen to be from a foreign country. 8/10
101,Koreans are the best,kidjej,7 September 2019,10,"Wow, what a story. Real relloercoaster, you get all emotions in this movie.
Korean cinematography is best by far. Hollywood needs to learn from them!"
102,We are all Hollywood parasites,Sir Gerry,13 February 2020,7,"As one other reviewer said, all the accolades have to do more with the idea other than the actual movie. TEchnically it is very well crafted, great cinematography, great acting, but personally I think overhyped. In a day an age where everything is political and has to do with social issues, a movie that very blatantly shows the disparages between rich and poor, (a little bit too stereotipically, I might add) is bound to get great reviews. Actors and their 200k bags of face creams like to feel they are connected to the poor massess, and social justice folk of Twitter feel they have been done justice, even if only for two hours on a theater. Hollywood wants to be that White Knight, and last year it paraded in their red carpet Mexican Native Yalitzia Aparicio, this year it was the Korean actors, I'll bet next year it will be another troupé. Like the rich family in the movie, minorities and other cultures are nothing but parasites to Hollywood, useful and good while they serve their purpose, stink bugs that have to be fumigated when they don't. No wonder 202 Oscars had the lowest rating of the last 25 years. Watch the movie for yourself and make your own mind, I don't think it is the 10 everybody is saying but its political message has provided the fuel to skyrocket it. Beware though, last 10 minutes are quite gross and gory."
103,Oscar Season is here,VallejoDiego,29 January 2020,10,I'm on an Oscar binge right now. And WOW this movie suprised me. Not a huge fan or foreign films and having to read a lot of the subtitles but I couldn't miss this with all the hype around it. Such a crazy thriller and a lot of funny moments with it as well. Not gonna give anything away because I feel everyone who sees this should go in it blind. By far one of the best movies of the year.
104,Bong Joon-Ho's most uninspired film to date.,mrcoletti,3 October 2019,6,"Before I attempt to justify the reasoning for my rating, I must provide a disclaimer professing my appreciation for Bong Joon-Ho's past work. ""Snowpiercer"" was the film that marked him on the map and allowed me to discover his other films, which turned out to be every bit as great as Snowpiercer was. I'm a huge fan of his, and I was extremely thrilled to hear of his unanimous Palme d'Or win. He's a great filmmaker and has the experience to show for it, and I'd say winning that award had been a long time coming for him. However, after my boundless anticipation for this film, and finally getting the chance to actually watch it, I was inevitably itching with a feeling of disappointment.I've read many reviews of this film, all of them flooded with unworthy praise. Many people have stated that this is one of the best films of the past decade, filled with ""metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout."" Others have stated that the film takes numerous twists and turns, and unfolds in ""satisfying, unexpected ways,"" leaving the viewer wondering what's gonna happen next. The former sentiment's mention of ""metaphors and allegories,"" and the way they are presented in this film, have been done countless times over the course of mankind's brief existence, and class conflict has been a recurring theme in anecdotes for centuries even before Marx introduced his theory, yet people still find this elementary concept somehow elusive. There's only one dramatic moment that could be deemed a ""twist"" in the film, which ultimately wasn't that surprising given the endless amount of times this corporeal narrative device has been used since the dawn of storytelling. Besides that moment, everything is utterly predictable. I don't understand how people can act like the film is some unprecedented feat which challenges themes never challenged before. Seemingly every Hollywood blockbuster thriller presents a concept not that dissimilar from the concepts utilized by Bong Joon-Ho for this film.Additionally, ""Parasite"" suffers from glaring screenwriting issues, the most blatant one being an over-reliance on convenient narrative tools to artificially move the story forward, rather than letting it flow naturally. I'm not going to spoil what exactly happens, but as an example, there's a certain set of stairs in the film that acts as the focal point for the story's progression. Characters make uncharacteristic mistakes that are beyond the realm of believability, which sacrifices the film's sense of authenticity and causes the tension to feel forced. Using gimmicky writer's tricks like this can make or break a film, and if anything, it shows a sign of sheer laziness from everyone involved in the screenwriting process, Bong Joon-Ho obviously included.Creativity is another criterion that I exceptionally value when judging a film, and ""Parasite"" lacks in that department as well. Simply put, it's a perfectly capable film made by a perfectly capable director. Nothing more, nothing less. On the absolute surface level, it's a supremely entertaining movie, and if you're typically non-analytical and you prefer shutting your brain off before watching a movie, then this might actually be a great popcorn flick for you. But as far as the artistry goes, there's nothing to really be had with this film. Bong Joon-Ho's prowess behind and in-front of the camera was to be expected: The performances, the cinematography, the quirky lines of dialogue, etc. But with the exception of the expected, every aspect of this film is totally unchallenging and risk-averse.All in all, I'm still content with Bong Joon-Ho's Palme d'Or win, more so for the excellence of his early work than for the film that actually got awarded. Do I think there may have been some politics/hidden agenda involved behind the scenes at Cannes? Possibly, especially considering the flak he got two years ago due to ""Okja"" and its affiliation with Netflix. Regardless, in the grand scheme of his filmography, I'd rate ""Parasite"" towards the bottom rung in his otherwise exemplary résumé. And if you're curious, I'd rate ""Memories of Murder"" and ""Mother"" at the tippy top, which shouldn't come as a surprise."
105,Can't fathom the love for this movie,mikemaxwellut,9 February 2020,2,"Don't get the love people have for this movie. It starts as predictable slapstick comedy, then takes a sudden turn into a bloodsport parable on class warfare, and then then finishes -- can you guess? -- Nihilistic irony! Oh, that is really original, isn't it? All of the characters are unlikable, one-dimensional, amoral, lemmings. Apparently, Korean free enterprise economy makes them this way and their personal aspirations, ambitions, and accomplishments are simply results of circumstance and luck, as the wealthy and the poor are equally dimwitted, amoral, and self-interested."
106,Parasite is an excellent showcase of fantastic writing,kaneeddy,3 February 2020,10,"Parasite, is Bong Joon-Ho at his best, I was at first sceptical when I was about to see this movie because of all the praise it had gotten, I was afraid that the expectations that were placed on it were too high and I would come out of the film disappointed. I couldn't have been more wrong, Parasite is fantastic, it nails a lot of technical aspects such as: Cinematography,editing and its production design which is right up there as some of the best production design this year. These technical aspects however are just complimenting the excellent writing by Bong Joon-Ho who manages to flawlessly ease us from one genre of film to the next. It covers comedy, drama, horror/thriller, and also manages to dive into social themes like class systems. The way it does all of this is so subtle, it doesn't go on a rant talking about the way people act when in different classes, it shows us, which I think is a lot more powerful. It doesn't villanize any one class, both the rich and poor people in this film have their good and bad moments making it feel even more authentic. The acting is also really strong I can't put my finger on one performance as it does feel like a strong ensemble effort.On the negative end however, some of the actions made by a character near the end of the film (Specifically the birthday party sequence), I just didn't agree that this would be something the character would do, I still found the actions performed to be entertaining, I just think this character could have made a different decision and would have as well.Overall, Parasite is a very well directed, written and acted film, which is enhanced even further by its excellent, cinematography, production design and editing. With great performances from an excellent ensemble, Parasite is one of the greatest foreign films ever made and well and truly deserves its Oscar praise."
107,Brilliant,cgoodwin1991,2 November 2019,10,"I reserve 10 stars for only the cream of the crop, and I can safely say after one viewing that this was just that.Masterfully done in every aspect. All of the acting, camerawork, and design was fitting and never over the top.The plot was wonderfully paced and the organic tension created was very effective. Furthermore, this movie had much to say thematically and did a incredible job conveying those thematic elements while staying within itself.I don't want to spoil even the slightest minor detail so that every viewer can enjoy this movie; as we are all only lucky enough to experience one so brilliant every five years or so. All I would advise is that you do see it, and for those of you averse to foreign films, don't let it impede you. It truly is the finest movie I've seen in recent memory. You'll forget it was in Korean."
108,great film,joesmarch-40368,5 February 2020,9,Well written and performed. Technically shines through and through. Probably the best experience in recent memory. Its pure art resembles and the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss this film. Definitely tops the list of best movies this past year too.
109,"Ineffably great, hard to classify film focused on class warfare",Cmiller75,3 November 2019,10,"It is hard to talk about this film without spoiling it surprises, so I will basically write a love letter to Bong Joon Ho's brilliant new movie. He effortlessly builds tension, while bringing so many other elements (Slapstick! Horror!) in telling the story a poverty-stricken family climbing for higher ground on the backs of the elite. It is a moving, funny, and above all else enlightening take on how the war of the classes leaves many, many casualties. Best film of 2019."
110,Fantastic!,catsy29,20 October 2019,10,"I don't even know what to say about this movie. Just go watch it. I watched it more than a month ago and I still think about it everyday.It has so many layers. This movie really impressed me, it was a completely different experience of what I was waiting for and I absolutely love that. It catched me off guard.It's such a fantastic social commentary."
111,Must see!,george-801-726596,23 December 2019,10,"Original, creative, involving story.Great acting with a crisp production.One of the best in 2019"
112,"Poor pacing, too few twists, too unbelievable",Groverdox,20 December 2019,6,"I think there's a really good movie buried in ""Parasite"" somewhere, but I gave up trying to find it. It has the same problem the director's previous ""The Host"" had: the pacing is broken.That's not all, though. People have written about the movie's unexpected twists and turns. The thing is, it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive, they are too few and far between, and too unbelievable. The first major twist happens about an hour in, and seems to come out of nowhere.The parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich Parks are the best bits, though they are far fetched: how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand?But then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly, until by the end I wasn't even paying attention.Pity. Some of the sequences were brilliant."
113,Perfect. Nothing to say,shyk-19404,12 January 2020,10,"Yup. I've been Watching Bong-Joon-Ho's movie, And this is an end result.
I won't say more. THIS IS A MASTERPIECE"
114,Regular Movie,mureedalsarraj-38032,2 January 2020,6,"I don't really understand the high rate for the movie, it is very normal expected movie."
115,Trying to Be Intellectual But Not Succeeding,dan-abbot,15 February 2020,1,"This movie is trying to say that capitalism is causing both the rich and poor to become parasites - the poor are scam artists lying for money, and the rich are using the poor to nurture their kids. But it's a mess of a story, not a ""masterpiece."" In the real world, the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead, but this movie doesn't have any depth - the symbolism is amateurish, the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent, and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic. The movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming, bumbling psychopaths, and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless. Sorry, it's an ignorant view of the world. It makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become. Or maybe Hollywood is trying to gain more money and audience share in overseas markets so they promoted this one."
116,"For lovers of film, Parasite delivers",john-1663,13 January 2020,10,"You may not like everything you see, but you will be moved. I can't add much to the many excellent reviews here except to say that this is a film for true film lovers, not movie-goers. It's a film that makes you laugh, cry and most of all, think. Do not try to interpret the plot literally. The story is metaphoric. Zen, not Hollywood."
117,Excellent!,milbertperez,13 January 2020,10,"Great work! from start to end, it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie, The most original film and one of the 10 best films of 2019."
118,Parasite (2019),paulaldriensantiago,24 January 2020,10,I find the film's visual symphonic. The use of montage in such a way that creates a flow of revelations. Camera movements are buttery smooth and well executed. The concept of the film which is about the social classes has paid such an impact to the audience. Bong joon-ho used such a technique in which he showed us the things that we may not be aware of. The film did a great job on putting its audience on a thrilling rollercoaster ride of emotions.
119,Shocking!,bryankhalid-92551,16 January 2020,9,"My first ever Korean film and the film lives to its expectation after seeing the movie trailer. It was mixed of comedy, suspense and even horror, go see it you'll be suprised!"
120,Brilliant and totally unpredictable,tilokaudaman,17 October 2019,10,"This film goes places where few dare to wonder. It begins as a dark, hilarious comedy but evolves into a startling, violent climex I will never forget. Everything about the film is exceptional. It is a true masterpiece."
121,"Started off great, then tanked - and I get the message",Top_Dawg_Critic,27 January 2020,6,"This film is either a love or hate review. I get that most that hate it maybe didn't understand the message - I did, but it was written in a mind-boggling illogical plot-hole ridden way. What makes it even worse, is how great it was from the start, that when the ridiculousness kicked in, you become extremely disappointed. There are so many ways this could've been written much better - and still get the message across, and maintain the initial theme without tanking. Directing and cinematography were excellent, and the casting on point. And the 132 min runtime was flying by, until the plot started to tank. Clearly over-hyped and not worth anything more than my 6/10"
122,Two discussion questions I enjoy,tomlinde,2 December 2019,10,"Rather than review, I like to add two cents to the conversations.One individual comments that she never rides the subway. What is the significance of the below ground/above the surface boundary? Which domain affords the better social perspective?And is anyone in this story not parasitic? Hardly anyone that I can identify."
123,Extremely absurd without basic logic,MovieIQTest,5 September 2019,No rating,"Huge Oscar Winner?! What a JOKE!There's no way or simply not enough to convince me that this 4-member family could have so easily conspired a big scam to wreck a rich family. The two screenplay writers, one of them was the director Bong, simply borrowed the mass majority feelings of the 99% struggling Koreans who deeply hate the upper 1% rich class people in Korea and made up a story that rendered a catharsis masturbation-like feel-good opportunity for the poor, a self-righteous, self-justified, self-indulgent revenge on the rich class.At the beginning of this movie, this lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They were just like you and me who don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.The most shameful scenario was the screenplay writers/director who made the rich people looked so stupid, naive, emotional fragile and so easily to be conned, they completely overlooked the fact why and how rich people became rich. The differences between the rich and the poor are many, but usually, it's because the rich people are smarter, more intelligent, more cunning, 1,000 times sharper than the poor, they are not so easy to be manipulated, conned, scammed, or swindled, otherwise they wouldn't become rich and successful. Yet this stereotyped shallow screenplay simply overlooked these facts and made the rich husband and wife so stupid and so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers who didn't even know how to make a basic living or how to pass the college exams.The screenplay made the rich wife a fragile, naive, shallow emotional wreck, but totally refused to admit that rich wives usually are split-hair sharp, otherwise they'd not be able to handle their social status. The husband in this movie also showed that he's a hardworking super smart self-made businessman and entrepreneur, he should not be so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers. Yet this movie, again, simply overlooked the realistic fact and made these couple an easy moronic target by the scammers.In summary: Zero Probability & Highly Unlikely! The long-term helpless 4-member losers were absolutely impossible to become a well-experienced, well-organized, smart grifters/swindlers. How possible these 4 lamers to could br so abruptly, so suddenly become so smart, so organized, so skillful overnight to carry out their scam step by step? It's against the basic logic and absolute impossible.The director/screenplay writers just used the majority poor peoples' hate/resent/bitter feelings against the minority rich people psychology, manipulated the poor audiences to have a catharsis moment in the movie theaters. If the audience in Cannes Film Festival gave a 10-minutes standing ovation, it only showed the majority of the audiences were also the majority poor, they finally got the opportunity to have a small window to vent their bitterness against the rich, so they were so generous to award this one-way street movie the grand prize.I don't know why the Korean movie makers are so obsessed in this kind of con-artist/imposter/swindler/fraud genre movies. Ah-ga-ssi (Handmaiden) (2016) is almost the same like this sucker, but that 2016 movie is even lower and abject than this one, but even that movie spent too much energy on the lesbian love-making scenes, these two movies are basically the same: HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE! SAME CRAP, DIFFERENT TITLE. Only people without any logic thinking ability would enjoy them. To me, both of these two movies are just a torture to watch. There are many other Korean movies all like these two suckers, so I think it's time to call off making such stupid movies.I'm a poor guy, yet I don't hate the rich people but envy them. I'm also a certified lifetime loser but I willingly admit that most of the rich people are definitely smarter than me, there's no way I could manipulate them and con even $0.01 out of their pocket."
124,For those who gave this movie 10/10,donyosmond,20 April 2020,6,"This film started well and I liked the opening dialog and the concept, but this film is simply not worthy of a Best Picture Oscar. There were too many disjointed scenes and bad editing. I think I need to see some more of this directors other films. I watched Okja and thought it was poor, so not sure what all the hype is about. 6/10 No doubt it will be remade Hollywood stylie but I wont be bothering to see it."
125,Just a really bad movie..........,pedronutjob,27 February 2020,1,"When I find myself constantly looking at my watch and asking when a film is going to deliver any of the promises that the Critics and Reviewers have seen fit to lavish on it then there's something awry.
This isn't scathing socio-political cinema...it's not black comedy, in fact it's not remotely amusing or believable or even sympathetic to any of its characters.
It's a simple hype job.
The movie here is the real Parasite."
126,Another great Korean film.,zachary-68690,10 January 2020,9,"This was one of my favourite films, great acting, I liked the characters and there was lots of suspense."
127,Very interesting plot!,barashka23,14 January 2020,8,"Great! Awesome! Very interesting plot! I think it is one of the best thriller of 2019! I'm not a fan of Korean films, but this is great movie! I hope it win one or few Oscars!"
128,This movie is sticking with me.,Brad_G35,26 November 2019,10,I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and it's sticking with me.I can't give a solid review yet because I'm still processing everything. Not so much processing but there are so many layers to this movie from rich to poor to cons to subtleties that the average movie-goers might miss.This is a must see and I truly hope it wins Best Foreign Film this year if not Best Picture.What a film.
129,Fabulous film,colinbilling,27 November 2019,10,"Ranks as one of the best films I have ever seen and I've seen many .Very clever , unusual story it's about as original as a film can be , it totally lacked the predictability of most US films.Don't miss it"
130,how sick/weird is this movie and still catch you in,ManD0wn,12 January 2020,9,"The only thing i would change on it ,is the end... , why the hell all that had to happen, the movie would be great with a different end.Overall this is quit intresting to watch... , to understand the culture , the limits between poverty and rich people , there is more but i don't want to spoiler it , so it worth to watch.The movie ended in hurry somehow ,not showing the life of Kim Ki-woo , i like that for the first time i see quality into this korean/chinese/japanese culture movies recorded .This movie is pure fiction , but is not feeling like it couldn't become a real thingh , because doesn't look that unrealistic to happen .I note it for 9 , because i would give it a different ending and a part 2 ! ,but maybe the director of the movie didn't had same vision as us tend to have .. , he wanted something sad to happen and the movie to don't end in just a happy end."
131,"A genius insight into class division, executed perfectly. An immediate all time great film.",o-73042,23 November 2019,10,"The best film of the year, maybe the best film of the decade. Just one of the best films in general. Joon-ho Bong balances a social thriller, satire and drama, perfectly and effortlessly. The cinematography is as good as I've ever seen in a film; the editing keeps it highly engaging; the production design adds the impactful disparity between the classes; the score and sound design adds significant character and emotion to each scene; and the performances are powerfully executed from the whole cast. Parasite deserves all the high praise it is receiving from critics and somehow, it deserves more."
132,Thrillingly hilarious and bitter.,Dev1999,20 October 2019,No rating,"Parasite? Brilliant. You heard it here first. It's like four terrific films put into one and somehow effortlessly so. It always subverted my expectations and was a very special experience. Everyone in the theater was completely hooked by it. Laughter, screams, gasps... How many films can do that? On top of that I'm sure I'll even get more out of it on rewatches."
133,Its ok,am-by,1 September 2020,6,"This movie for me is a solid 6. It's obstacles are from critics reviews putting it at a 10. Its not that good and cant live up to those expectations. If you watch it , you wont have wasted your time. If you don't watch it, you won't have missed much. Its average."
134,The clear Oscar frontrunner,understorey,14 January 2020,10,"This year the Academy Awards have gone even more nonsensical than usual. Not only did they unjusitfiably snub many deserving people and movies, but over-ladened a few films with much more recognition than they deserve.Once Upon A Time in Hollywood - 10 Oscar noms. (why?)
Joker - 11 Oscar noms. (why?)Parasite? 6. (all deserved).Basically, the Oscars are more of a joke with each passing year. However in saying that, at least they gave 6 nominations to Parasite, which in my opinion is the clear frontrunner for Best Film.It's the most interesting and engaging movie of the year, and the most successful Korean movie in history, both in Korea and around the world. I highly recommend it."
135,Good but Not Great,k_fogleman,5 June 2020,7,Best movie of the year full of suspense and white knuckle moments is the hype. Not the reality. A unique story that misses a lot of opportunities in it's execution. A highly unsatisfying ending. Lots of loose ends. Didn't live up to the hype at all. An enjoyable watch but less suspenseful as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
136,"Overhyped, not that interesting and long",vickythomson,18 February 2020,5,"I'm sorry but I must be living on another planet - I can't understand why this film won an oscar and why some are rating it a 10.
I felt a little bored in parts and I felt uncomfortable. Reading some other reviews after the film, maybe there were some aspects I hadn't analysed and worked out intellectually. But then still I felt it was totally over hyped."
137,Brilliant and one of those very few films truly deserving 10 stars...,mdw0526,11 January 2020,10,"I absolutely loved this film. I thought it was sad, darkly funny, discomfiting, and absolutely brilliant. It's hard to talk about the script and its astute observations about class and equality without giving too much away, but oh my, so many stairways so leaden with meaning. If you aren't into foreign movies because of the subtitles, I'd still highly recommend seeing this. He is such a master of image and setting that it conveys as much as the dialogue. I've got ""Snowpiercer"" lined up to watch tomorrow for a full-on Bong Joon-ho weekend."
138,mind blowing,yeahsine,25 December 2019,10,"I don't know whether if it's just me but each member of the ""parasitic"" family reminded me of some or other person that we would have met in our lives and even to ourselves. It is one of those movies that has brilliantly captured human greed and class discrimination on-screen.
The film starts out portraying the Kim family, their love for each other amidst all the poverty and difficulties and their omnipresent desire to grow rich. A ""lucky stone"" introduced in the beginning and running throughout the plot probables resonates with a classic human trait, clinging to the narrator throughout the plot. The all-too-powerful plot throws up some brilliant twists that could never have been guessed upon.
One of them leading to the protogonists' running away from the affluent Park's home after an eventful night. This scene is potrayed too realistic that it produces a sense of helplessness in the viewers. This juncture in the movie was too overwhelming for me- the brilliant but subtle portrayal of the darkness clouding into their lives and the classic reminder of ""actions gone too far"" makes you feel for them.
The transformation that the narrator's father undergoes after this night and his subsequent actions is a powerful blow to the socio- economic casteism that is present in our world.
A brilliant masterpiece that deserves to be watched and felt upon!!"
139,It's hypnotic,ernestocatalan,9 February 2020,9,"You have to watch it for yourself to appreciate the story telling and cinematography. I'm a superhero, dumb action flicks type of person but once in a while I can appreciate a good film and this is it."
140,Masterpiece,Ynocrozplatfom,26 December 2019,10,"Perfectly told story with perfectly logical plots and motives for every character, justification for every frame and accompanied by a thought-provoking message that lingers long after you leave the theatre. Surely one of the best of cinema."
141,The Best Film of 2019,MovieRiffing,6 January 2020,10,"Parasite stands atop the rest of the competition as the best film of 2019. Director Bong Joon-ho delivers his masterpiece, a film that has you hooked from the very beginning. Over the course of Parasite's runtime, it draws you deeper and deeper into its world, demanding more and more of your attention. Just when your investment in the characters peaks, Bong Joon-ho takes Parasite off the rails and delivers a striking message on the innate struggles between classes. Add in fantastic performances and cinematography, and you have the must-see film of 2019."
142,Great allegory,adecio,31 October 2019,9,"I predict a strong hard campaign to make this South Korean movie become a hype until to get its deserved Oscar. The allegory is pretty awesome. I recommend to get a blindly watch, because this could be very useful. I'm gonna pay attention more on next Joon-ho Bong's projects."
143,I don't get it,120watts,12 April 2020,7,"It was entertaining, with good execution. But best picture?Some people seem to love the fact that it switches masterfully between genres, which to me seems like something that would excite a movie geek or critic more than it would a regular viewer.Others delight in the ambiguity of not quite knowing whom to root for - while that might distinguish it from a stereotypical ""american"" narrative it hardly elevates it to some exalted status. To its credit, I think the strongest feature of the film is that the director brilliantly manipulates the viewer's emotions by superimposing classically sympathetic elements onto the objectively non-virtuous and indeed villainous. What seems relatable and sympathetic in the moment is actually part of a pattern of deeply objectionable behavior, while what seems moderately dislikable is actually fairly mundane. This incongruity is layered on to brilliant effect.Now, many are praising the supposedly deep, revelatory social commentary on the nature of class struggle, but I don't find it nearly as profound as is claimed. The overtly sensational, absurd plot if anything detracts from the relatability of a social message, and the storyline (even leaving aside the over-the-top scenes that are exaggerated for cinematic effect) is chock full of innumerable ordinary lapses, discontinuities and implausibilities to the point of distraction. More importantly, the characters are all minimally developed and characteristic of a one-sided view of the world in which people act out their base grievances and fantasies over a veneer of class-determinant normalcy. It strikes me that there is little to no consideration of virtue, even in momentary antithesis. Yet if this is the social revelation then it is a deeply cynical one, and also an implausible one because the world is not so one-sided and simple. For this reason, the film ends up revealing very little realistic insight into the human character or social dynamics. It is not a bad film as it is well executed and clever in its emotional manipulation, but I am not willing to dole out gushing praise."
144,Parasite 2019,CaseyRyback1992,19 December 2019,10,"With this tough genre mix, South Korean cinema has created a masterpiece. The complex and fascinating examination of the class struggle once again underpins the ingenuity of its director Bong Joon-Ho."
145,good movie,muratbilir,15 January 2020,7,Beautiful movie congratulations. story beautiful movie
146,"Still wondering ,why this got 4 oscars",panoscharalabidhs,29 February 2020,4,"I wanted really to liked it ,but I couldn't.
I liked only the last scene ,but I could not like any of the characters.
I don't know if that was the purpose ,but for me at least one character has to be likeable.
And all the poor-rich thing has been told better from soap operas."
147,Parasite Is An Upper Class Movie,WillsFilms,8 February 2020,8,"Parasite is a fantastic movie that features sympathetic, yet morally gray characters and their plight to earn enough money to live. Despite the awful things the characters do, you feel for each and every one of them thanks to the fantastic writing and acting. The humour is also fantastic and always lands. Seriously, despite being a drama, Parasite is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. However, the reason why I can't say that Parasite is one of 2019's best movies is the ending. The ending is so anticlimactic, disappointing and dissatisfying. It didn't feel like that was what the film was building towards at all. However, I still recommend Parasite as it's mostly a fantastic experience that I just wish had a stronger conclusion."
148,Parasite teaches an important lesson,donnielovesmovies,10 November 2019,10,"Parasite (2019)10/10 💸""Such immense effort put into a film about the high and low class, Parasite is as surprising as it is a nail biter that keeps you guessing until the very end.""The struggle of money is a huge and impactful aspect of the everyday lives us human beings go through everyday. No matter the case, desperation is imminent and dire actions come into play. Parasite does away with telling a tale of class, greed and the values or family. Director Bong Joo-ho, who brought you The Host and Snowpiercer, creates a layered masterpiece that keeps you on edge every second due to the flawless writing and acting within acting (if you watch you'll understand) that keeps Parasite from ever falling under. Even the score and cinematography assist the film in being anxiety inducing. Although it is considered a crime/comedy, I found Parasite to be a scary type of film. Think about it, manipulation can occur at the hand of anyone that remotely tries it, no matter how witty and/or smart the victim is. The horrors of reality stand and it is never too safe to be alert of the occurrences that surround you. Getting to the ending, which I will discuss briefly without giving anything away, is the kind of ending that provokes nervous laughter at the hand of suddenness and sensibility. It's one of those endings that involve so much, but that much just happens to work so well in the film's favor. It's haunting, it's daunting and serves the purpose of leaving a mark.Verdict: Parasite is one of a kind and is easily one of the best films of the year. There's nothing to not like about this and it'll sure stay with you after the first viewing."
149,Must watch .. one of the best ever,ayush-799-885425,16 January 2020,10,"Brilliant . First time have seen a Korean film and cannot be more impressed.
It's like Satyajit Ray meets Quentin Tarantino ..
Social Cast issue with so many symbolysims meet brutal reality and violence.. depicted in a witty thriller .Kudo's"
150,Well deserved,Mikkel-egebjerg,10 February 2020,10,"Just watched this film yesterday, really love this story. And surprised the academy even knowledged it.😳"
151,The hype is warranted.,Keallach,21 January 2020,9,"I've wanted to see this awhile, but the consistent rave reviews actually made me hesitate and put it off, for fear of disappointment...nothing is ever that good... but I genuinely and thoroughly loved this!The themes are common enough, but told in such a way, and with such a unique story, to be legitimately fresh. The subtle nuances of performance can sometimes get lost in subtitles, but not in this case - each actor transcends language in conveying their character. The plot twists and turns between random chuckles and stark darkness from the start to the shocking, sad and satisfying finish.The hype is real - definitely one of the best movies of the year, and of recent years. Don't miss it."
152,"Parasite Review: Comedy, drama, suspense, and yes, even horror.",robfollower,9 February 2020,9,"A family who doesn't have a lot of money or opportunities in life, starts working for a wealthy family. But will this change the life of the poor family?DIRECTOR: Bong Joon Ho
SCREENWRITERS: Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Wan
CAST: Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, Chang Hyae Jin
In the movie, we follow the Kim family who doesn't have much money. By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.Then the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!The cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing.So, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10"
153,Overhyped,cshelton-86906,1 December 2019,6,"The hype surrounding this film is too much, hearing people rave about it, calling it a masterpiece, movie of the year, even film of the decade. With all that praise, I expected it to be on par with films (in terms of storytelling, acting, script etc) like The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption or Park Chan-wook's Oldboy, but no, it didn't even came close. But still it was a very entertaining movie, people only overrate it."
154,You gotta watch it.,angiedisa,17 January 2020,8,"The only reason I'm giving it a 8 it's because I wouldn't watch it again.
Gave me so many emotions, it was a whole rollercoaster. I felt anxious, worried, sad, and even happy at some point.
Made me feel fear at so many scenes, it really plays with your mind.Masterpiece? Yes.
Would I watch it again? Heck no."
155,"Masterpiece of the 2010s, best Korean movie since Oldboy",busfahrer09,2 January 2020,No rating,"Without my habbit watching all Korean movies an airline has to offer on bord entertainment I'd probably never heard of this movie, depending how deep its run in award season gonna be and I hope it goes deep.The movie is captivating from the first second and shows quite quickly which morbid rabbit hole it's gonna go down and depending on your own character you like it at that point or you start hating like the 1% here on imdb...everything else already got written, not getting the Academy Award for Best Foreign Movie will be the biggest snub ever. Period."
156,"Good , over hyped",kevparker-50116,6 February 2021,7,"I enjoyed this movie, however my expectations were so much higher than it delivered based on the hypeIts good, but not top 50 goodI feel being a foreign language film gives it some level of credit with critics keen to promote something cool/exoticAsk yourself how this film would have been received if set in US or UK and in English ? I feel it then would be just a good 7 out of 10 dark comedy / farce.Definitely worth seeing, don't let the hype set your expectations too high and you'll enjoy it for what it is."
157,Overrated,LabaKase,5 January 2020,1,"I can't believe that this movie is being called a masterpiece, it was ok at best. To me it feels like the director wanted to represent the feelings of the lower class population towards the rich but he failed miserably because its potrayal of both the rich and the poor is so illogical, I honestly felt like I was watching an adaptation of a bad fanfic. I think only people who are easily impressed would enjoy this movie."
158,"YES, YES, YES!!!",evito1,8 November 2019,10,"Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in the recent years. The laughter, the suspense, the shock, ... and especially the hilarious twist in the middle! At the same time it presents a wonderful critique of society. I just LOVED it. Everything you'd expect of a Korean movie and more."
159,Parasite (Spoiler Free),brodysmatthews-84808,9 January 2020,10,"Last night was one of the most thrilling experiences I have had watching a film..I attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house. I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.As I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year.
The first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining.Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen.Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.Grade: A+"
160,"I Love You, Mr. Bong! (heart)",luisbunuel-551-242485,30 May 2019,10,"As a long-time fan of Bong and Song, I always knew this pair would make it at Cannes someday, and finally!!!! ^_^ (~Naneon Bong-iiyah~) I purposely never watched a single trailer of this in order to fully enjoy it and I'm glad it turned out Bong had made up for Ok-ja very successfully. Also, I'd like to add that Moongwang, the former housekeeper was ridiculously good. Despite all the laughs throughout the movie, it's quite bitter and sad and gets you thinking of the modern hierarchical, absurd society where we live in, all the way back home. I hope Bong's next movie would be just as good as Parasite."
161,Bong Joon's best work till date,salmanb-50652,1 February 2020,9,"There are many reasons why Korean movies are a top notch and Bong Joon is definitely one of those. This Lynchian styled narrative is surely to take you for a ride. The movie starts with a light hearted tone but gets seriously dangerous with unexpected turns of events. The movie shows off the dark secrets of both rich and the poor and our judgement towards them. It's a confusing perspective for the viewer on who to feel sorry for, which side to take. Excellent!"
162,A masterpiece,OPPATRIA_,2 November 2019,10,"""Snowpiercer"" was very good, ""Parasite"" is even better! Bong Joon-ho delivers a clever analysis of the class society in which we live today in his ingenious thriller, which is horror film, comedy and drama at the same time. A poor family invades the home of a rich family and starts working for them. But who are the real parasites? The society of the rich is characterized by friendliness and serenity - but it's precisely this habitus that you first have to be able to afford. And it shouldn't fool us about the balance of economic power. We don't see good or bad individuals in ""Parasite"", rather Bong Joon-ho has created character masks for his characters in order to expose the class relations. Moreover, ""Parasite"" is a thrilling and aesthetically brilliant movie, in which there isn't a single wrong picture."
163,The perfect movie doesn't exi-,gabethurau,7 November 2019,10,"This is one of those rare movies that actually transcend the astronomical hype surrounding it. So many elements of this film are packed with depth and richness. Funny, brutally sad, suspenseful, entertaining, and strange. Cannot say enough good things about the seamless transitions and rhythms of the directing.Parts of this movie have been branded in my brain forever, and I'm completely fine with that.I am huge Bong Joon-Ho fan, and this is his best movie to date. Right above Memories of Murder."
164,I hate to say it but...,ShuhratGlazkov,23 July 2021,6,"The only reason this movie got the fame and awards it got is because it is a korean movie. And let me be clear here, not just specifically korean but literally any non-US movie on par with Parasite in terms of quality would have been as successful as Parasite anyway; with a bit of luck of course. Actually not just a bit of luck; they would need all the stars in universe to align as well because that's what happened with Parasite. It is nothing but an average movie that only got this boosted because some people decided to take a look outside the rock they have been living under for over decades and they saw this average movie and thought ""That's a lot better than what I expected!"". Domino effect followed and today, we got this movie that's overrated and predictable. No different than your average ""ThRiLLeR"" movie.P. S.: The only reason I went this hard on the movie is because the internet went so good on it and the movie got more than it deserved anyway so keep calm, the movie is still watchable; when drunk."
165,Amazing movie,hmingtei,14 November 2019,10,"One of the best movies I have ever watched in years. The life of the rich and the poor yet never felt cliché, not even once. Very unpredictable and the anxiety you get from watching the movie is thrilling yet you don't know which character to root for because they have their own stories. So please watch it,, you won't regret it."
166,Half of a great movie,Anseldog,30 October 2019,5,"Overrated doesn't even begin to describe this film. I'm a fan of the director and am always excited when a new film of his is announced, and so it was with this film. Sadly, it does not deliver like his other works do. Performances are all uniformly excellent - particularly that of the poor family's father and the house maid of the rich family. Inventive camera work, a few chuckles here and there and a halfway point twist that makes you extremely uncomfortable and excited for where the story will go next and then...the story just takes a nose dive off of a cliff never to recover. As the film crawled towards its conclusion I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. By the time it's hoping to be  ending arrives, I had already checked out. An interesting failure with a lot on its mind, but in the end, what's really underneath it all is a muddled point about class that isn't truly made. I would like for the film to have gone farther and darker than it did or to not have gone dark at all in the first place. This is a film that tries to be too many things at once and leaves you feeling cheated of seeing the movie you thought you were going to get. I keep thinking back to the one review blurb from the trailer (paraphrasing) ""a film that starts out as one thing and then becomes something entirely different"" - yeah, becomes a big stinker."
167,Amazing!,cruzjuanportales,30 January 2020,8,"One of the best films!
The way this movie takes you in the history is just the right way, everything connects perfectly. Well written and there is no notable mistakes.
If you like thrillers and seen other things that American films this is the movie.
One of the best movies in 2019"
168,Amazing absolutely loved it.,XabisoM,11 January 2020,9,"Great movie, great writing, greating acting and great cinamotography. The only reason I am giving it a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the ending.I feel like filmmakers should have had the guts to leave the ending messy with a bit of mystery. After Mr Park gets stabbed they should have just ended it there, that would have had much more of an emotional effect on moviegoers."
169,Love these kind of movies!!!,steffanyzimmerman,11 January 2020,9,"Cinema at its best. Hi I'm Steffany. World Cinema has got to be apprecited. Enough of Titanics, and Avengers already!!"
170,Best movie of 2019,shakoor-ans,18 January 2020,10,"My favorite movie of 2019..
Hope it gets Oscar for best Picture"
171,Parasite is a very rare film ...,N18hthawk,17 January 2020,10,"Parasite is a very rare film. IMDb have it listed as a 'Comedy, Drama, Thriller'. These three just don't do it justice. It certainly has some very funny moments ... but it's equally depressing and sad (both in a good way) as it deals with tough subjects like injustice, poverty and class. It certainly is a drama; each character has multiple situations ranging from normality to crisis. We watch as these scenarios merge and cultivate themes and topics to contemplate. Yes, you guessed it ... it's also a thriller; the storytelling beautifully builds up, twists and works to a crescendo.However, the film has so much more. There's plenty of argument to add 'Horror, Romance or Crime' which are all blended into the colourful narrative. Plus, this film is the quintessential 'Family' film; yes, the families are in 'interesting' situations, but the shades develop and raise questions on many layers. The fact this film can do all of this and stay even remotely coherent explains why the film is rare. The credit should go to the sharp writing and directing of Bong Joon Ho and the brave and touching work of the actors.Now ... it's a long way from 'perfect' in my opinion. I've scored this film a 10 here as it just crept into the required range with 91/100 using my own scoring system (I have my own detailed method). It's certainly true that some people won't enjoy this film. Of course, the genre mix I describe above may put people off straight away. Without saying too much that gives anything important away some might feel the underlying themes have been done before and that the film can feel confused and ambiguous (on a variety of subjects and positions). You may also need to deal with a film without an obvious 'hero', characters with whom you may struggle to empathise (especially by the end) and an 'unlikely' main plot and close.Personally, none of these impacted my enjoyment of the movie in a significant way. I'd primarily put this down to the direction, screenplay and acting. There are small moments in the film, which resonate as they underpin the themes. I found 'Parasite' thought provoking and engaging throughout."
172,A Rollercoaster of emotions,hadih-20244,13 January 2020,10,"This movie is a masterpiece
I really had good times watching ever minute of it. From the topnotch storytelling to the ideas it portraits, its definitely a movie that will stick in your head far after the credits."
173,An OK movie,Tuumis_,29 February 2020,6,It was OK. Not sure what's the fuzz around it tho. Slow paced drama/triller with very little plot and excitment. Felt pretty boring most of the time.
174,The best film in 2019,MehdiTaba,11 January 2020,9,"I doubt that there's a better film out there than this masterpiece in 2019!Almost everything about this film was perfect with numerous messages, elements and layers.The production and performance were magnificent. The humour ""Black comedy"" was great, the ""Pain"" was real and the cinematography was dazzling.I'd like to thank Bong Joon-ho in person for this masterpiece!""Poverty and being indecisive can make life a perfect mess and miserable""9.2/10"
175,Disappointing,nerdwinkle,24 February 2020,6,"Was expecting a great movie about social inequality. I find I usually agree with the IMDb rating. But this movie was NOT about social inequality or class status. It is about a down on their luck con artist family. Completely understandable the boy lying about going to University to get the tutor job his friend recommended him for. But morality is thrown out the window when his sister lies about the schizophrenic zone on the kids painting. Totally unnecessary and cruel to mislead a parent with mental illness fears. But then the family lies, manipulates, and scams two people to get fired. Deplorable. Do people do this cause they are poor? No, it's cause they are criminals. There are criminals at all social levels. So this is NOT some type of movie about social inequality. How disappointing.. but as a movie about scam artists it was entertaining how clever and shameless they screwed over two workers. But true to form the scam is threatened to unravel."
176,not only overhyped--actually just stupid,amelia3,29 July 2020,3,"I think the great cinematography has tricked audiences into thinking this film is a whole lot deeper/more groundbreaking than it actually is. It has the plot of a rom-com with some gruesome flourishes at the end that allow people to turn this into some type of incisive social commentary. Wow! Class differences exist! Thanks Bong Joon-ho for enlightening me.Just because you've successfully deciphered what the director/writer sought to convey doesn't mean he's necessarily saying anything profound. People need to stop patting themselves on the back for understanding the meaning and realize that, despite the pivotal role of the underground in the film, its significance remains painfully surface-level.I see a lot of people separating this movie into halves--and it's fitting. During the first half I was fairly interested and as I saw it taking on the plot structure of a lighthearted comedy where we willfully accept unrealistic events, I started wondering how the hell it had won Best Picture (alongside the universal acclaim).Well, after the former housekeeper's return, the stupidity that ensues (yes--that moment and the very end inclusive) signals a dark shift that is surely what summoned most of that praise. However, it's here where the film starts to break down for me.We accept the gullible mother and seemingly passive father as the opposite family begins to infiltrate at every opening. That's ok for some time, for some genres, but I simply cannot find the absurd a fair foundation on which to build a tragedy. The existence of the first half of the movie makes it impossible to take the second half as seriously as we are supposed to. And on top of it, I genuinely don't care what happens to any of these people (save a tinge of regret for Mr. Park's taking a knife to the chest), I find it impossible that the tutor-son could survive two (2) skull-crushing throws of a rock to the head, and I genuinely cannot think of anything stupider than Mr. Kim committing the murder in the first place, even given the heat of the moment and his motivations.I was almost peer-pressured into giving a higher review for the simple fact that I've seen none so low as mine, but 3 just feels right. Something unconnected that I need to insert; the comedy element that seems to be so present to others isn't even there for me either. It's smirk-with-one-corner-of-the-mouth funny throughout, but never really hilarious. It's prettiness is its strongest feature and to say otherwise is contrived."
177,"Just when you think you've seen it all, a movie comes along to shatter all your beliefs.",dhunjiwadia,6 February 2020,10,"Parasite is a true work of art and a rare and extraordinary masterpiece that should be viewed by all, especially film lovers. If you're planning to watch this movie avoid spoilers at all costs. It will have you conflicted on who you are rooting for. Parasite taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between the rich and poor around the world. It's a darkly, entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family and the rich Park family, their polar opposites. The film makes you play a guessing game on which of the two families are more rotten. Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. It's best to go into the movie not knowing too much about what you're about to see, and let it's sly power sneak up on you. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich that suck the marrow of the poor."
178,Kinda messed up,alexsong88,4 September 2019,10,Didn't expect the ending...which is why I enjoyed it. Shades of the cult classic 'Old Boy' in the sense that there were elements that were so disturbing..
179,Exceeds every expectation,Kethina,2 January 2020,10,"I read a lot of rave reviews about this before I saw it. I also saw it on many ""must see"" lists the past month, so I thought, alright I'll watch it, and approached it with a ""show me what you got"" kind of attitude. It didn't take long before I realized that I was watching something incredibly different. In fact It is incomparable with anything I've ever seen before. It belongs and at the same time doesn't fit in in any kind of genre. It is as thrilling as the best parts of Gone Girl and is everything Jordan Peele's Us tried to be. I would say that this is the most divine work of cinema I've seen in many many years.Some people refrain from watching foreign language films. I find myself paying more attention to the plot since I have to read what is being said. This is very beneficial to a film that demands your attention at every single moment, which this one does.Parasite deserves a 10/10 because of the very simple reason that I wouldn't want to change a single second of it, everything had purpose. So watch it, I bet it will exceed any expectation you might have from reading all of these reviews."
180,one of the most wonderful things i've seen,filizkirkan,2 January 2020,10,"Midway through the brilliant and deeply unsettling ""Parasite,"" a destitute man voices empathy for a family that has shown him none."
181,A metaphorical pun,rizwanshaikh473,21 January 2020,9,"It was a great movie, a metaphorical pun intended to show the differences and/or similarities between the two major classes of the society, i.e. the rich and the poor. It has an extravagant climax which will not be liked by majority. However, the climax was justified afterwards. It was a great drama. I enjoyed watching it. Once the movie gears the pace, it was impossible to leave your seat without watching it full at one go."
182,The best film of the decade perhaps,pmdotr,30 October 2019,10,"Simply put, there's no way to explain what a masterpiece of satisfaction this movie is. Just watch it.
I don't even want to explain what it's about...I think it's best if you just blindly go into it. Completely expect it to win best foreign film at the oscars."
183,Incredible,iamkeysersoze-13228,24 January 2020,No rating,"I went into Parasite blind, I literally almost knew nothing going in and that was probably a good thing. Parasite is flat out a work of art. A lot of films can be considered brilliant or a masterpiece but this film is definitely one of them.Parasite is one of the freshest films I've seen in ages. It's a story which is executed so well. It's a work of art and the whole film is complex, funny and somewhat terrifying at times. Both the first and second half of this film are both works of art. It is one of the best written films of the year and of the decade.Everyone is terrifc. Kang-Ho Song and the cast are incredible. There is no faults in the performances. The cinematography is also absolutely wonderful and it's seriously well directed.There isn't anything negative to say. It's one of the best of the year and decade. It's whatever everyone has been saying and I wouldn't mind this winning best picture."
184,Parasite,Prismark10,24 February 2020,7,"Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture Oscar. The first third of the film had me wondering why.The film opens in a dilapidated, smelly semi basement in South Korea. The Kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbour's wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected. They make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes.Dad, Ki-taek is the weak link. He cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted. Son, Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune, when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma. Ki-woo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy Park family who live in a lavish mansion. Soon Ki-woo gets his sister Ki-jung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son.The wily Ki-jung conspires to get the Park's family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father. Before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother Chung-sook.All of them claim to be strangers to the Park family, pretty soon the Kim's are earning good money and living well. They are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy Parks.Their good fortune is threatened when one night when the Park's are away on a break, the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind.I thought the movie would turn out to be similar to Joseph Losey's The Servant which was scripted by Harold Pinter. It goes in that direction but then swerves off.When Bong Joon Ho accepted his best director Oscar he publicly thanked Martin Scorsese. It was his movies Bong studied in film school. The key is Scorsese's own British influences ranging from Ealing Films, Hitchcock to Powell & Pressburger.There is a parasite in the Park household but the film is about class. A fatalistic, metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy.Parasite has a heightened reality, the Parks are wealthy who never look down even in their own house as they have no need to. They are nice but when one of them inadvertently mentions the odour of ordinary working people, like those who travel in crowded tube trains, they seal their fate.Bong shows that those in the bottom rung of South Korean society cannot advance very far. Ki-woo has a dream but it is more likely to be dashed, fate and fortune will ensure of that."
185,I have never seen a movie like this!,idamarie-28624,6 January 2020,10,"It was a wonderful movie, truly! I did not expect that level of acting and the way the movie was shot really stands out. It was, amazingly enough, filled with humor (both dark and stupid humor, the whole room was straight out laughing at some points! ), love, hate and passion in a way that I cannot describe. I jumped and screamed in my seat several times and by the time i left the movie theater my heart was pumping in my chest and I felt like I just had completed a marathon. My head is still spinning from all the plot twist, that I did not see coming! 10/10 would always recommend and hope to see it again soon!"
186,Great,michaeltrivedi,16 January 2020,7,"I tried to watch this movie once, and faded out after the first ten minutes. It's surprising too, as the first scenes with the slacker family were very, very funny and entertaining. It reminded me of the beginning of Old Boy in a way. Upon my second viewing, I was stunned. Fully engrossed, and entertained all the way through. This is perhaps the best film of the year (I haven't seen Little Women or 1917 yet).The story is about a slacker family who stealthy make their way into the lives of a rich family by becoming their employees. The rich family doesn't know they are related. The poor family discover a man living in the basement, who happens to be the former maids husband. Violence ensues, and the movie just becomes more detailed, fun, thrilling, and entertaining all the way through.Usually movies tend to drop out near the end, or close to the climax. I find I usually get bored at this point. This film doesn't do that. It almost reminds me of Fight Club with its dark humor and thrills. In fact, that's the only movie that comes to mind, though they are very different films. Parasite does have its own take on class, which is very prevalent. It seems the rich and poor are very similar, with the middle class not even being presented in the movie.Overall, this is a tremendous movie. I'm glad I gave it a second chance. Probably the best movie of the year.7 stars"
187,Overrated,manolo-webmaster,18 March 2020,5,"From the first scene this movie reminded me of Almodovar, but without the required intelligent effort to make it a credible story. Metaphorical? Yes and no, that's where they lost me. The pace seems fast, but then I found myself wanting to fast forward a number of times, since the overly simplistic plot turn into absurd rather too quickly. If this is the best movie of the year then Hollywood has a very serious problem."
188,"Chicago, Illinois",AgustinCesaratti,28 December 2019,10,"I absolutely loved this film!, the best of the year by far in my opinion. Everything was masterclass, the acting, directing, writing, tech aspects. lol in my top 100 for sure."
189,The best movie of the year!,dipinheiro_dsp,21 October 2019,10,"I just watched the movie and found it simply wonderful. It is a mix of moments that happen as fun, joy, tensions and sadness. The climax scenes of the movie are breathtaking and all extremely well fitting, you realized it was no trick of the script to make those scenes happen, everything flowed very well. I'm amazed at the movie, a lot of people need to see this work for yesterday!NOTE: The counterpoint of the rain scene is ""because of the rain the rich can't get to camp"" and ""because of the rain the poor are obliged to camp (in the gym)"""
190,Palme d'or? It's a gem!,Strivingforfairness92,2 November 2019,10,"This is a very rich film ""with metaphors"" as the young hero of it might say. It is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction, writing and acting are very cleverly done. The themes of the have-nots against the haves and the cold-hearted versus the warmer-hearted people dominate the plot, which is thick. There is a lot of symbolism in it. Who are the real parasites, anyway: the poor or the wealthy, the caring or the indifferent? The tone takes a turn three-quarters of the way through from French-farce style to almost a horror film. However, it is worth engaging in until its conclusion, as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed. I can see why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2019; it's a gem."
191,Masterful storytelling that fully utilizes the art form.,mudblood477,14 November 2019,10,"Bong Joon-ho seems to be incapable of making a bad film and this one might be his very best. Parasite is wickedly funny, stunningly tragic, and just gorgeously constructed from beginning to end.The visual storytelling here is immaculate, the stair sequence, in particular, is incredibly crafted.The sound design and soundtrack are superbc subtle and strong in all the right places.This is probably the best-paced film I've seen this year, there's virtually nothing I could think of to trim.I am deliberately avoiding talking about the film in more specific terms, you don't need me for plot summary there's plenty of that online already. Though I would suggest avoiding all of it if you really want to get as much out of this film as possible. Family is certainly a strong theme as is class struggle if that helps.The acting is all excellent. Song Kang-ho continues to be one of the best actors working today. The dude will have you cracking up and then choking up within minutes of each other.I'm not really able to talk about this film at length without spoiling it so I'll just say if you're a true fan of film, this is not one you can miss. This is the type of movie that reminds people why they love film in the first place.10/10 First a trickle, then a flood"
192,"Make a plan, life will change it...",deshaver1,9 February 2020,9,"I didn't know what to expect from Parasite. After a few minutes, I found myself with the same feeling in my gut as the first time I saw Rocky. I was really rooting for this impoverished but street smart, underdog of a family. The story moved forward and I found myself not sure of how I felt about them and their charade. The acting and directing are tremendous! The pace of the film leaves you suspended in anxiety. But what an incredible film it is. Without question one of the best films I've seen in the last five years. Certainly the sleeper film for the Academy Award. Excellent, 9/10."
193,OMG...must watch!,ben_vogel,28 November 2019,10,"First and foremost, this movie is a must watch! It starts funny, becomes interesting, and then holy ****! The writing, directing, cinematography, and acting are all masterclass. To sum this movie in a few words I would say it's a dark comedy tragedy(if such a thing exists). Also, if you see this movie and want more check out the director's other movies that are also great; Snowpiercer, Mother, and Okja. Most of his movies, including Parasite, are about the classes we fall under and even though we may be from the same country, same race, whatever, we still see each other so differently because of this."
194,piece of art,ii13,25 January 2020,No rating,"One of my best films, rarely comes across such a fascinating work that satisfies the soul's need to receive and taste creativity and art. According to Hegel, the soul also has its needs,i think that the parasite has fulfilled it."
195,Were the blueprints to the house never filed with the local planning commission?,Otkon,12 April 2020,6,"See, while the film is moderately entertaining, it is flawed. It certainly isn't a masterpiece in any regard.The massive issue is that there is not a single sympathetic character in the entire film. Because the Kims are poor, we are supposed to forgive their unethical and often malicious ploy? The Parks are just vapid stereotypes of the wealthy. The driver is underdeveloped. The housekeeper we feel bad for at first. But she and her husband quickly become as detestable as everyone else.So the Kims only means to finally making something of themselves is through dishonest work. All the energy and ambition they put into their scheme, they could have used to start something legitimate like their fake referral service. But their deception was always depicted as a means to a fatalistic end. Are the Park children any better for the tutelage they are receiving? No. Is the house any cleaner? The chauffeuring all that life-transforming? Naw. Perhaps if the Kims' presence in the Park household had had any positive aspect to the interaction between to the two families, the movie would have invoke some pathos at the same climax.And the ""wealth rock"" symbolism. Got it. If they were so smart, they would realize simple living within your means is the key to contentment. So, yay, never hold your metaphor - as the writing rule goes.And the climactic punishment is not nearly sufficient. For the Kims, it's one dead, two on probation and one ""scot-free"" after racking up a host of crimes including one triple homicide - only a third of which was of a different socioeconomic class. That is some good karma for railing against the rich and being utterly deplorable schemers but mostly killing their own kind. Yeah, yeah, the dad gets trapped under the house. How was this proper retribution? He was never the mastermind; his rotten kids were. And mainly, it was the son, who is the agent of everything. Without his friend, without him receiving the stone, without his foot in the Parks' door, there is no movie. The daughter gets what she deserved. But he gets ""lesson learned (maybe)"". And Mrs Kim is just along for the ride? A big fat no to that.I also found it hard to believe that the source of those flickering stairwell lights would not have been investigated by the fastidiously rich residents with their impeccably stocked wine fridge - especially with Neurotic Helicopter Mom no. 1 always home.I already was well-aware of the rich-stay-rich-and-poor-stay-poor cycle that was supposed to be the revelatory theme of this movie so it was not nearly as impactful. And with the characterization and outcome flaws, the film was okay but not nearly as evocative as it could have been. I really wanted to see some arc movement to any of the characters, even if ever so slight before the same ending. But they all start out and stay one dimensional. And it takes a bloodbath at a child's birthday party to get a couple of them to say, ""aw shucks, maybe this wasn't a great plan"". And then the final point of the movie, per the director himself, is to just accept your impoverished state because even years of honest work will not get your murderous father literally out from under the rich that you caused to begin with by seeking to be like them. ""The whole notion of ""why bother"" makes no sense or point thematically in art."
196,One of the best I have seen in a long time,plupu66,27 October 2019,10,"This film is a powerful parable. If you like straightforward Hollywood films - with good guys and bed guys and an obviously predictable plot - DON'T see this film. It will leave you confused, even annoyed.
If, on the other hand, you want to see a film that will make you think and reevaluate your view on modern human society, it is a must see for you."
197,Engaging but didn't match the hype,CtlAltDel,18 February 2020,6,"I won't go into the details of the plot which can be read elsewhere but simply give me impressions. Well directed, interesting story (even if there were some clunky moments), good acting, good dialogue but way too long.People are raving about PARASITE. I'm not one of them. Masterpiece? Hardly. All the characters are supremely unlikable. Perhaps that was intentional. Ironically, the rich family provoked more sympathy which I doubt WAS intentional. I racked my brain wondering why people are so enthralled by this movie. Do you suppose bc it has a sub text? I mean, of course it has a sub text. it is a satire on the relationship btn the rich and poor in Korea. But that is plainly obvious. It's not subtle. Actually it's not even a sub text, it IS the text. But up against Hollywood cinema which rarely has ANY sub text and usually just presents us with a story on the screen writ large PARASITE then is seen as sophisticated.I didn't rate PARASITE very highly. That's my loss I guess."
198,Just OK for me,acromegalix,4 April 2020,4,"After a first screening in a theatre, I couldn't understand the hype around PARASITE. So I watched it a second time at home and once again wasn't impressed at all.
I suppose it's just not my kind of flick, and as I write this review a few months later, I realize that I don't remember much of it, even after seeing it twice.
I have read all the praising comments with a 10/10 note, but couldn't find any of the qualities described, as if people commented another movie."
199,Worth Watching.....................,sapatwalaa,24 December 2019,10,One of the best Drama-Thriller movie I have seen in years. Plot is fresh as ever. Cinemetography and character developement is at its best. Want to see more movies from Sir Bong Joon-ho.
200,The best flim of the year 2019....a masterpiece,prenalrai,6 December 2019,10,"This movie is easily the best of the year in the entire world. The legendary director Bong joon-ho known for his movies (memories of murder, the host, snowpeircer, okja) churns out yet another masterpiece "" parasites"". The movie completely engages you through its brilliant storytelling. The comedy , humour, suspense , thrill and drama elements keeps you hooked into the screen. The peformance of all the actors are top notch. The flim is a visual treat filled with lot of suprising moments. Its very rare to see such kind of story telling on the screen kudos to the director bong joon ho and his team for experimenting with such theme. The movie is by far the best in its genre and will be remembered as a classic. It wont be wrong to say that this movie is definitely among the finest movies made in this decade."
201,Parasite will leech into your heart.,lmcerrado,24 January 2020,10,"An instant classic! It's a rollercoaster of emotions that makes the heart pound and the breathing hitch. Parasite follows a poor family who have methodically and charismatically inserted themselves into the lives of a rich family, but even the best laid plans can go wrong and the parasitic family find themselves in deep trouble. Somehow, these characters are very likable despite all the things they have done to get themselves to the ""top"". The performances delivered by the cast is phenomenal, and nothing negative can be said about what they brought into the film. Dialogue is very engaging and riveting, it makes the ears wide open to be able to hear it all. The story is well executed and well paced, there is never a dull moment even during the more quiet scenes. The editing and sound is masterful as it adds more to the film's atmosphere of tension and ease. The statement it makes on the economic social classes is clear and can keep someone up at night. Overall, it is one of the best films I have ever seen and it is one of the parasites I am happy to have in my life."
202,Polished and Masterful,sheldonnylander,19 October 2019,10,"The working class and down on their luck Kim family struggle to make ends meet. When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo's, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an ""in"" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.This movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn't shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don't feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience's guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.However, I do say it's MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we've found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn't feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren't surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!Another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It's a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don't spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don't have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn't essential to it.This film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don't see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I've seen in 2019. Highly recommended!"
203,A fantastic film. See it before the inevitable bad American remake.,Jester222,12 January 2020,8,"Looks like a few people failed to grasp the films message. It's a more cerebral watch than their intellect can handle. Ha ha.A dark dramatic black comedy film with a strong social commentary.Hugely enjoyable and well deserving of its many accolades.See it now before Hollywood tries to remake it and ruins its excellence.
A fabulous director."
204,Parasite and Schizophrenia,jimbikerider,15 January 2020,9,"An incredibly complex and multifaceted film that takes the audience to a place they have never been; inside the mind of a person afflicted with an incurable mental disease: Schizophrenia.
There is a legend/reality/ myth among mental health providers that one fifth of all cases of Schizophrenia is caused by a parasite from contaminated water.
Rarely documented as hard scientific fact; it actually fits in quite well with the Masterful presentation of Parasite.
Throughout the movie, one cannot escape the feeling of surrealism. That things don't quite seem possible to pull off and yet they do, with the help of a young man, IMHO that has has all the tell take signs of the disease: overrinflated worth, that he so desperstely desires and concocts by being selected by an acquaintance (of upper class) bypassing well trusted friends to venture into the slums of South Korea to give the young man his trust any honor across class lines to teach a wealthy girlfriend of his, despite the la c k of college training but perceived mastery in the English language through delusion,
Validated by a near perfect counterfeit degree from Princeton University, verifying his talents.
Similarly, his Mother as the rest of the family enslaved in Making a living through folding pizza boxes.
In his fantasy, each family member assumes the role of an important support system for a family of the elite class.( In reality, would never happen, and for his entire family to be get positions and be payed well through a scheme, satisfies his fantastical delusion of wealth and success for each family member. What could be better?
A symbolic rock taken ( but gifted in the mind of the actor) from the home of great distinction, must be placed in the exact location it was taken from to complete the fantasy
Clues were given throughout the movie, just enough to have you scratching your head on the possibility of such an incredible sequence of events that only really made sense if it was only playing out in his mind and not reality.
Paranoia slips in with the hint that the family they are scheming somehow knows their plans of taking over the house. For example his imaginary girlfriend not looking all the way under the bed where he was hiding in one seen, as he covered his eyes as to make the discovery go away because of the mental trauma associated with such humiliation and embarrassment.
The Upper class father's suggestion that the panties left in his car made no sense to him, yet he blamed his driver of poor conduct and infidelity anyway, as a most revered and trusted employee. And on it goes.
The young boy, who needed art therapy and special treatment was actually the son of the outcasts as a young boy, suffering a seizure in the first grade, common for Central Nervous System Parasitic infections.
The final revelation occurred at the end of the movie, completing his story with a letter to his father, that he will eventually come and save him.
However, earlier in the movie, their home and the entire town was destroyed by s freak flood, with contaminated water that displaced the entire community into a shelter.
Yet, the basement, the glass, and the condition of the living space, filtered through low lighting, was still intact, as was he, holding on to the completed Memoir of his personal experience that was as real to him as day and night to you and I, but only rang true through his tortured thoughts from a terrible disease: Schizophrenia.
The reader is encouraged to do a search of two words: parasite/ Schizophrenia, for more expanded descriptions of Schizophrenia and the legend of Parasitic causes."
205,Absolutely riveting,Red_Identity,2 September 2019,No rating,"Wow. What a film. The experience of watching it is surely one to behold and one to remember. What is especially striking about the whole thing is just how well-constructed it is. A film like this, trying to do this much both narratively and thematically, could have easily fallen apart in the hands of most directors. Bong Joon-Ho is incredibly skilled in how he handles this script and his fantastic directing. Really amazing piece of work that I hope gets a ton of accolades."
206,Not terrible but clearly overrated,clockworkorange13,13 May 2020,7,"Parasite is a highly polished and pretty-looking movie but it falls short in a few ways. My biggest issue was that I couldnt care less what happened to any of the characters since the parasite family are just lazy and pathetic scam artists with no redeeming qualities, and the rich family are basically clueless airheads. I really had no reason to care what happened to any of these idiots in the story. The movie also suffered from a severe case of ""tonal whiplash"", meaning the tone was all over the place. Sometimes it wanted to be hilarious like a slapstick comedy and sometimes it wanted to be taken fully seriously, like a straight drama.Also, in the last quarter, the story pretty much ran off the rails and seemed to be dragging on and on in so many different directions that the movie lost all sense of direction and purpose. This wasnt a terrible film but its a little baffling that it is so highly praised.The movie also has some glaring plot holes, like where did all the broken stuff on the floor go when the rich family got home? I guess if this was a silly cartoon for children that would be acceptable but not in a proper film."
207,Great movie... Very complex.,timothy-lawless,18 January 2020,9,"This sort of reminds me of a mix between comedy and drama. I understand that parts were meant to be funny and because of the difference in culture and sub titles, lots of the humor was lost on me but I could tell that some parts were meant to be funny. It was all very interesting and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I thought this was a horror movie and it is not at all. More of a tradegy and social commentary. The smell didn't register with me either untill nearly the end but it was a great plot device."
208,"Original, Unconventional and Overrated",claudio_carvalho,17 February 2020,7,"When Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik) is indicated by his best friend, who will travel, as the replacement English tutor of a teenage daughter of the wealthy Park family, he is immediately hired. Soon he foresees the chance to bring his poor unambitious family to work for the family. The Kim family plots a scheme to fire the Park´s driver and the housekeeper and soon his father is hired as driver, his mother as housekeeper and his sister as arts teacher of the wealthy family. When the Park Family travels for camping, they stay in their house as if they were the owners. But soon something happens that will affect the Kim and Park families.""Gisaengchung"", a.k.a. ""Parasite"", is an original, unconventional and overrated black comedy by the South Korean Bong Joon Ho. The film is good and the plot is funny, dramatic and suspenseful but there is no motive for the hype around this movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Parasita"" (""Parasite"")"
209,A movie made by a 'far away' country doesn't make it a masterpiece,James_Denton,9 November 2020,4,"We live in a time where liking the eccentricities born from different cultures with a sprinkling of foreign language makes something supposedly good.However, the moral from Hans Christian Andersen's story 'The Emperors New Clothes', is: telling ourselves something is 'good' doesn't mean it is; and, that is very much the case for Parasite.In the main, the film isn't too bad. A poor family move in on a wealthy family and it eventually leads to tragedy. The acting is only 'alright' but certainly not fantastic as many reviewers say, and the viewer doesn't learn much about the wealthy family. The film also leaves many unanswered questions, such as:What happened to Ki-woo's friend who went abroad, and, what did he make of it all at the endWhy did Ki-woo's father do what he did at the endWhat was the point of the love interest between Da-hye and Ki-wooIt's all a little silly reallyThe film will appeal to:Supposed 'film critics' (i.e. The type who claim certain wines go with certain foods) who more often than not follow the norm of other 'film critics'The 'eccentric'Millennial's who:1. Wave the flag of support for anything foreign

210,JUST GO OUT AND WATCH IT,MovieRickk,23 October 2019,10,"Usually I dont comment/review the movies I am watching, but this one deserves it. Dont know what to say, just a MASTERPIECE.Advice: Dont watch the trailer or try to get any information about the movie, just go out and watch it."

Absolutely perfect,bennyandjohn,10 November 2019,10,"This is a rollercoaster of a film,it starts off with us seeing the situation of a poor family,the friend of the family's son gives him an offer of his job and tells him to forge his graduation documents,after learning the son needs an art tutor he lies to get his sister in,I can talk about a lot of things,but the garden scene,phew what a scene. The underground husband stabs Jessica (the sister),the father attempts to save his daughter,Mr park asks for the car keys,the father tosses them and...well anyone who's seen the film knows the scene,bong joon-ho has proven he is an amazing director worthy of winning many rewards with this film alone"
212,"Stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence, it's explosive filmmaking on every level.",chasemykleby,6 November 2019,10,"""Parasite"" Review
(10/10)Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho has made a South Korean social satire that's also a genre-bending Palme d'Or-winning thriller of class struggle.
It's best to go into ""Parasite,"" the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you're about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo's father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again.
The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie's themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song's stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun's swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi's eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust.
At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one's family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor?
The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It's explosive filmmaking on every level."
213,It's nature.,kingkass,14 January 2020,9,"This film shows humanity in all its glory. We can try to claim the rich are evil and the poor deserve better but these are delusions we create to make us feel better. People are terrible. They are selfish. They are greedy. They are unkind. It's part of human nature. No matter how much you have, or how little, humanity still exists, and humanity is the problem.All the problems in the world that make us suffer day to day are caused in the end because we are human. Nothing we can do about it.The movie was good. Lol."
214,Masterpiece,mehulchavda-71067,20 November 2019,10,"This is true masterpiece
It's unpredictable i love this movie"
215,Plot and tension at its best.,shimenpf,22 January 2020,8,"What a great movie. No words. For very long moments I was so immersed that I forgot I was watching a movie. The plot is greatly crafted. It always moves forward and escalates. When the story requires it, the tension is remarkable. I think the father's reason to kill Mr Park could've been established a little clearer, but anyway the movie is great."
216,"In any successful black comedy, GREED is GOOD.",aarosedi,29 September 2019,No rating,"My rating: A-plus.
(Just like what others have already stated in this comment section: BEST WATCHED WHEN ONE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FILM:)Starts with an unemployed Ki-woo who was asked to replace his college student friend in being a rich girl's English tutor even though he hasn't got qualifications apart from having been a repeat-taker of university entrance exams...This one ends up becoming a thorough scrutiny of the gluttonous side of human nature which is always a welcome and an essential ingredient in any bitter satire that's in the same vein as one of those Coen Brothers' films. And this one needs to feed off the audience's unabashed derisive laughter for it to deemed a worthy yang to the yin of that J-P Jeunet classic Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain or even to a lesser extent C Nolan's Inception. Whereas the wistful rom-com and the meta sci-fi have its darker elements in the narrative neatly tucked away in its recesses, the Palme d'Or recipient does the exact opposite. Such dualism that occurs in the cinematic world is much needed which serves to cleanse each other's cinematic excesses. And it took a long time for a film like this Korean one to come by and serve as a worthy film to counterbalance the sentimentalism which can only be considered to be a magnet very much ripe for any Cy-Bugs to devour wantonly in such an orgiastic frenzy.But the film itself can be considered as sharing the same kindredship and is way aligned more to the thematic and aesthetic sensibilities of Yorgos Lanthimos' ones (Dogtooth, The Lobster, or even the Favourite), if not quite to be considered as it's ugly, distant cocaine-junkie cousin, shares the same filmic DNA sure, though fun at parties but can be a bit of a deadweight accomplice. Whereas Boon-J-H's film is more rooted in emotional judgments that each of the characters made that has quite sensible outcomes, Lanthimos' looks like the logic that pervades throughout have just been delivered via a spaceship that endured light-years' distance flight.Kudos to the brilliant actors and the technical crew that delivered polished work, all had their share in driving the narrative the writer/director put forth for it to become a resounding triumph. Made me laugh so hard I feel the need to re-watch it again soon. Not to give much away of the story, I will only mention one that's among my favorite scenes, that of one character's delicious rant mimicking North Korean newscasts delivered with much hysterical gusto. I can't help but fall out of my chair on that one. It is such an impressive, inspired work of an ensemble that might just beg for an American language remake because the immediacy of the issues explored might be considered to be a meaty enough for the Hollywood actors to consider sinking their teeth into, that is if the richness of the allusions that are very particular to the Korean identity and consciousness does not work against that thought."
217,Good but not as much as they say.,lucas_mrz,10 January 2020,7,"This movie delivers everything you can expect after watching the trailer. It's an enterntaining dark comedy that has some ""drama"" and even has some tense, thrillerish moments. It won't dissapoint you, but it's not the best movie of the year, nor the best korean movie ever made. It's not even that weird or unpredictable. It's just a good movie, not an otherwordly experience. But it won't dissapoint you, you should definitely watch it."
218,Bong Joon-Ho's Masterpiece,grantpaulsen,14 September 2019,10,"Bong Joon-Ho is a filmmaker whose work I've admired since I saw Snowpiercer (2013). I've had my eyes on him ever since and I'll watch pretty much any film he directs. His newest film Parasite (2019) is not only the best film I've seen from him so far, but it might also be the best film I've seen so far this year. He may have crafted his own masterpiece. This film is sharp, it's tight, and hooks you till the very end. It's very fast paced, it's an extremely intense edge of your seat thriller, and its comedic at times which adds some levity to the film. The performances are all excellent across the board, the script, the dialogue, and the writing are all brilliant, and the score is very intense and enthralling. And to top it all off this film is shot very well, the cinematography and directing are great, and the shot composition is very interesting. And above all else this is just a very fast paced and interesting film that was incredibly fun to watch. I can't wait to see it again, I can't praise this film enough in words. See it as soon as you can, I highly recommend it, and it might be the best film I've seen so far this year!"
219,Best Korean Film of All Time - Parasite,arthur_tafero,31 January 2020,7,"This is the best Korean film of all time. Now that is not really saying much, as Korean films generally finish fourth in a competition with Chinese, Japanese and Indian films in Asia. But if this film is any indication, Korea may be on the cusp of jumping over one of their competitors in Asia. This black comedy has the feel of Coen Brothers special, though not quite as pithy or broad. There is more character development here than in most Coen films (with the exception of Fargo). Joon-Ho does a great job of writing and directing and brings his vision home to roost without any apparent flaws. Each actor in the film does a very nice job, with the daughter of the hustler family (I love good hustler films) doing an outstanding turn. I look forward to Joon-Ho's next project."
220,"It told A story, nothing about people. That's all about the movie!",bonnieliyl-390-713688,4 January 2020,5,"A story there was. Thrilling scenes there were. Some pretty cinematography yes. Solid character build-up, hell no. Logical plot, no. Entertainment, not much. Consistency of characters, missing. Petty resentful ignorance towards the rich, yes. Narrow and shallow depiction of the poor, very much.So not convincing. Every stretch of the movie i thought I started understanding the characters a bit more, but no, next stretch would make me scratch that understanding and try to rebuild again.. In the end, it made me fail to attach with any of the characters.Without enough entertainment, what were the film makers trying to tell the audience? I completely don't get it.Really doesn't match the hype. Wasted two hours of my life."
221,I love this movie!,seanfett,2 November 2019,10,"Oh man so I love this movie. Beautifully shot and exquisitely acted. Parasite is funny, tugs at the heart strings and is super dark just like I like my films. The director Bong Joon-ho has delivered yet again. I'm in on everything thing else he makes. Go see this movie in the theaters while you can and if you miss it, definitely watch it when it's streaming you won't be disappointed. Parasite is a 10🙏🏻"
222,Wow!,tyrinalcott,12 October 2019,10,I heard nothing but great things about this film and upon watching it I had no idea what it was about or what to expected. I'm glad I watched it because it was like nothing I've ever seen before. I could definitely say it wouldn't be as impactful to me if it was American production with an all American cast. I would definitely recommend this watch!
223,Different,sarpsenesen,1 January 2020,10,A movie that doesn't really belong to any genre. Still impresive story telling. One of the best of 2019
224,Perfectly done!,Irena_Spa,22 November 2019,10,"At first sight I gave 10, but being close to the end of the movie I was thinking...""no, no 10, but 8"", because I doubted how they could miss what was with Moon-gwang, and then the story mentioned what was with her and I moved back to 10. :) The whole concept is great, from the story, music and photography to acting and style. Next to that is there are many genres in one. Also, in several moments it drives you to think about many things how would you react, gives mockery and shows the human nature, essentially."
225,Best Thiller Movie,Ring_of_Sun,6 November 2019,10,"In starting 1 hours story is simple but then story make one after one thiller new type of suspance that's make this movie great .
This movie can thinking everything many type of question & ending is super-level...."
226,A wonderful black comedy,slyofwar,5 December 2019,10,"This movie is great it's hilarious, gripping and intense the less you know before seeing it the better"
227,I don't get it...,camjace-45174,16 July 2021,6,"Maybe I'm dumb. But given that this movies on paper is a masterpiece to me (I'm a big fan of Memories of Murder and Chaser ) but as execution, I feel like I'm fed a messege. And that broke the fourth wall for me.The first half is masterfully plotted and acted and directed. It could have just stuck to this story and the eventual clash with the rich family. But the plot in the basement and the overall comic tone in the second half, it lost me.It lost me even more that it's hailed as a masterpiece for Oscar. It's plain to see that Oscars have a political or some kind of Agenda. I mean over the years there has been foreign masterpieces that no one even considered in Oscars."
228,Movie of the year,victorjonel,11 November 2019,10,"The suspense, drama, accuracy with the real life, visually amazing. It's just beautiful."
229,Overhyped,pushu4390,27 March 2020,7,The movie is not what I expected. And not as brilliant as it was being told. I chhod have easily skipped this without regret.
230,I am one of the few considering this movie over rated,bmmalbuquerque,23 April 2020,3,"The movie itself starts fine. The pace is interesting and such, until that... It basically doesn't has too much to offer. It has some suspense and some insane plot twists, but that's basically it and I don't understand all the hype revolving this film."
231,An incredible film which doesn't reduce itself to one genre,RoosSmit,29 September 2019,10,"I expected a lot from Parasite (Gisaengchung) since it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and because i really like Bong Joon-Ho's previous films.Still, it exceeded my expectations. It's a comedy, Drama, Thriller and Horror film in one. Sometimes there are films which you know are going to be liked by people who are film enthusiast, but not by the general movie going public who go to the cinema to be entertained. I think Parasite is going to appeal to both film enthusiasts and the general movie going public.The cinematography and mise-en-scene are beautiful as it often is in Korean films; the style is very similar to Burning by Lee Chang-Dong. But the story is something else. During the first part of the film it seems like a comedy and makes you laugh, but then after a while the story becomes more and more serious and eventually turns into a thriller/horror. I'm not going to say more about the plot/story than that because i don't want to give anything away and because i think you should go into this film without knowing anything.This film is simply a must watch!! No wonder it won the Palme d'Or."
232,Humanity's Parasite,kirtapx,24 January 2020,9,"A 2019 south korean film that shows the contrast between two families from different spectrums of the hierarchies/classes and the how individuals can turn into parasites, the film also blended both comedy and dark disturbing tones very well, while also delivering stunning vissuals of the use of camera work done masterfuly."
233,it shows life and some important facts,yushhkh,4 September 2019,10,"This movie lives in this time
An amazing sweet thriller movie.
Great in every single part of the seventh art especially in dialogues which are great no formality in them. Characters talk like ordinary people act like ordinary people they feel happiness they lose temper they succeed and they fail. And after all of these for converting a good movie to a great one you need to be in front of audience I mean the movie should conflict the audience mind and show them some facts. In this case facts are some of the most important ones in our modern life they are about class distinctions which is the difference between rich people and poor people that is getting larger every day and it is the greatest problem in my society finally when you finish watching this masterpiece ask yourself who is the real parasite? The poor family or the rich one which are sucking their stinky blood"
234,This is what I call a proper korean movie,majgotra,4 October 2019,10,"After watching the most overrated korean movie ever ""the burning"", I almost lost the trust on imdb reviews but this movie put my trust back. It has everything, comedy , thrilling elements, suspense, emotional moments, satire and each and every actor played their role perfectly. It was treat to watch this movie. Highly recommended, just go for it."
235,A film that will keep you on the edge,joszhua,24 January 2020,10,"Parasite is a masterpiece and it is worth all the attention that it's getting. The script is very flawless and the cinematography captures the beauty of how the production designed each and every place. The actors executed their part very well and whenever they speak in English really entertains me and give the mood a comedic atmosphere. The whole film is very mesmerizing to watch and how you get to have a light comedy at the start that turned real dark by the end was a perfect blend on how to play the audience's emotions and get them fully engage in watching. I gave the film a 10/10 because the way they made the film was smooth, clean, and gorgeous in a way that you could get drowned in the details of every part of it."
236,Best Movie of the Year!,kevinraffay,1 February 2020,9,"Epic tale of class distinctions in modern-day South Korea. Ironic, clever, and touching."
237,I was wrong ...,goddangwatir,9 February 2020,No rating,"In my latest IMDb review, I wrote the following;""1917 is British director Sam Mendes' latest opus. I also believe that it is the next Best Picture, and that he is worthy of his second Academy Award statuette for directing.""Don't get me wrong, 1917 is a splendid and absorbing war movie. But after watching Parasite, I no longer agree with my earlier statements regarding Oscar statuettes ...Parasite is perhaps one of the most unique films I have ever seen. One second, it is a hilarious comedy, and in the other, a terrifying horror flick. Suddently, it turns into a romance and then you find yourself watching a jaw-dropping thriller. The greatest thing about it, is that you don't even notice these dynamic changes in genre. The natural flow of the movie is just so beautiful.I don't even know how Joon-ho was able to craft such a film as Parasite. No single shot is wasted, the intelligent script is baffling and sometimes the characters feel even more alive than real people.Some complain over the fact that the film is in Korean, and that you end up reading the subtitles more than watching the actual movie. I find that statement to be nonsense. Maybe it is because I am quite used to reading subtitles that I find it to be so (I am from Sweden), but perhaps also because the acting is just so good that you know the feelings of each character just by looking at their facial expressions.To conclude, I wish for Parasite to win five out of six possible nominations at the Academy Awards tonight;Best picture:

238,Noted Korean director's enjoyable grifter family farce devolves into unfunny bloodbath,Turfseer,17 October 2019,6,"Bong Joon-Ho, the celebrated Korean director, actually won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for Parasite. His ""heroes"" at the outset are the Kim family, semi-lovable con artists led by dad Kim Ki-taek, mom Choong-sook, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jeong. They live in a dirty semi-basement apartment in a lower middle-class part of town where they barely get by folding pizza boxes. The fun part is that the parents view themselves more as partners in crime with their kids and encourage them to engage in any kind of unsavory activity they can get involved in.The inciting incident involves Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk, who informs his buddy that he's going abroad and he'll gladly give Ki-woo his job as tutor to Da-hye, the daughter in the wealthy Park family, whose father is CEO for an extremely successful tech company, provided that he can convince the Parks to take him on.The fun begins when Ki-yoo cons Mrs. Park into believing he has impressive academic credentials after forging diplomas using some computer software. Ki-yoo goes right to work seducing the impressionable teenager Da-hye and then convinces Mrs. Park to hire his sister Ki-jeong, as an art therapist for their young hyperactive son Da-song.Before you know it, Ki-jeong (who calls herself ""Jessica"" in the Park household) plants her panties in the one of the family cars, leading to the firing of Mr. Park's driver, who's now suspected of having a clandestine affair with a girlfriend. Jessica now introduces ""Uncle Kim"" to Mr. Park as a new potential driver; the ""uncle"" is of course Jessica's dad and he's immediately hired by the unsuspecting father.The family has one more hurdle before gaining apparent hegemony over the Parks. Housekeeper Moon-kwang, who has been a fixture there for ages, will not be so easy to get rid of...until it's discovered she's allergic to peaches. So when Jessica applies the smallest of tinctures from a peach brew, poor Moon-kwang is felled by her allergies. When ""Uncle Kim"" convinces Mrs. Park that Moon-kwang is suffering from tuberculosis, Mrs. Park has no choice to fire the hapless housekeeper.Parasite takes a dark turn when Moon-kwang later returns to fetch some of her belongings and soon it's revealed that her husband Geun-sae, on the lam from loan sharks, has been hiding for the past four years in the basement where there's a secret bunker (the Park home is a veritable mansion with the secret bunker doubling as a fallout shelter originally designed for protection against North Korean missiles!).When Moon-kwang discovers the new ""hired help"" are from the same family, she records footage on her cell phone proving that they're simply a bunch of grifters and threatens to send the clip to Mrs. Park. When the Parks suddenly return early from a camping trip, the Kims scramble to confine the housekeeper and her husband down in the bunker. Choon-sook ends up pushing Moon-kwang down the stairs after she tries to escape and hits her head, suffering a concussion.As the noted drama critic Eric Bentley once noted, farce is ""permitting the outrage without the consequences."" The Kims and the Parks can do all these crazy things without any consequences since up until this point, the story is supposed to be a farce. But once Moon-kwang is pushed down the stairs and suffers a grievous head injury, Choon-sook is no longer an amusing character.A series of events then take us further and further away from the amusing spectacle we were enjoying minutes before. The Kims (minus Choong-sook) manage to flee the mansion after the Parks return home, only to find their apartment flooded during a storm. They're forced to sleep in a gymnasium during the night. Moon-kwang then dies from the head injury. The next day, Mrs. Park throws a birthday party for Da-song and the three Kims return.Parasite gets more bizarre and unpleasant when Ki-yoo, wielding a rock given to him as a gift by Min-hyuk, goes down in the bunker and attempts to kill Geun-sae, who ambushes and hits him in the head with the rock. The sight of the bleeding Ki-yoo will disappoint all those who were hoping the farcical goings-on will continue.But it gets worse. Geun-sae goes berserk and stabs Ki-jeong to death, only to be stabbed and killed by Choong-sook with a meat cleaver. Mr. Park, desperately trying to retrieve the car keys so he can take Da-song to the hospital after the child has had a seizure, gets a whiff of the dying Geun-sae, whose smell repulses him (it's been revealed earlier that Park has a revulsion to the smell of certain lower middle-class people). When Ki-taek witnesses Park's reaction to the smell, he goes berserk and stabs Park to death.Finally, we learn that Ki-yoo survives after undergoing brain surgery. He and his mom, Choong-sook, end up getting probation while Ki-taek takes refuge in the bunker where no one finds him. Ki-yoo fantasizes of the day he'll become rich, buy the now sold Park mansion and reunite with his dad.Some have said this is some kind of meditation on the class differences in South Korean society. Those differences are highlighted comically through most of the film but with the ensuing bloodbath, the comic tone is lost. The principals all receive their comeuppance which is good I suppose, but without the playful tone established early on, Parasite ends up feeding on the viewer, whose initial high expectations are ultimately left unmet."
239,Grows on you,peterghawi,9 February 2020,9,"I rated this a 7 yesterday but after a full day of thinking about it, I must say it's really good. Slow burn, it has everything in it. Unpredictable and makes you react outloud"
240,It's not better or worse than ok,georgetdog,9 December 2019,6,"I didn't fall for the hype. The acting and visuals would be close to 9/10. They definitely made the movie. However the application of the story let it down. A lot of decisions made by the characters were just not believable.
For example it is believable, very rare but has happened, that someone could hide in a secret area. But definitely not believable if they use morse code through a light every night and not get found out. Feeling downtrodden because of the way others treat or think of you is definitely believable. But stabbing someone because of this does not translate to the real world. How many people in the real world are treating a lot worse and don't stab people. And a lot of scenes were bordering on slapstick with out comedy."
241,"Long, with inconsistent characters and no moral compass",altereggo123,30 August 2019,1,"This had the makings of a fun farce. As I watched the first hour or so, I thought it could be a madcap Hollywood comedy. Implausible, yes, but amusing in an absurd way.But then it started to go in weird places. Some will call it social satire, but to me it was just dark, amoral and incoherent.The protagonists (the family of scammers) are profoundly unsympathetic. They wreck the lives of everyone they come into contact with, and some of their victims are just fellow struggling domestic workers. Yet the film-maker seems to see them as the downtrodden heroes of the film!Their story also makes no sense. When we meet them, they are solvenly, helpless, inept and unemployed. In the opening scenes, they are scolded for doing a simple job badly-assembling pizza boxes. But then suddenly they become master con artists, taking over all aspects of the lives and household of a wealthy family, running everything with efficiency and aplomb. This is just bad writing, not a masterpiece.While their employers were absurdly naive, I didn't hate them as much as the director seemed to want me to. Yes, they are silly, but they are also hardworking and accomplished, they love their kids, and in almost every way, they are morally superior to the people preying upon them. In the director's upside-down world view, their wealth and comfort makes them deserving of whatever happens to them. The fates of the employers and their original employees don't seem consistent with any sort of moral compass.Without spoilers, all I can say is that the climax and ending of the movie are unsupported by what precedes them, not just in a moral sense but also in terms of the characters' previous behavior. If the writer of this film had expressed the message of the film as a simple essay, unadorned with acting and cinematography, it would be dismissed as a childish and unintelligent mess.I would not recommend this so-called masterpiece, though I do think a other director with a lighter touch could remake it into something more coherent."
242,What a good movie looks like,aocorzo,18 January 2020,9,"This movie is clever on so many levels, the acting is impeccable, the story-line unexpected and the directing flawless but I don't want to give too much away, just watch it. In this era of super heroes and sequels, this is a breath of fresh air and a sign that there's still hope for the craft."
243,What does this movie mean?,snow-tim,27 October 2019,10,"So, you think you're going to ""fast track"" your way to the good life huh? By taking a short cut here, a little lying and deceiving there.Well maybe.. it seems to work for some, why not for you? (I mean how else did they get there, right? By being honest? ..oh please!)So you decide to take the ""easy"" road. One lie opens one door, then another, and yet another.Things seem to be going so well for you. You're getting ahead without having to make any real sacrifices. All of this unearned wealth is just within your reach.But one night...~~~~~LIGHTNING! ~~~ THUNDER! ~~~~~...comes a flood.And the entire foundation your life is built on, washes away.Turns out all those lies, short cuts, and easy way outs were not good building material.You had the wrong plan. You walked the wrong path. And you made the wrong sacrifices.You thought you were taking the easy way out, the short cut.Look at how wrong you were.In the end, you lost everything: Your sister. Your father. Your home. Your freedom. Your health.Tell me again how this was suppose to be the easy way out?My god... would it not have been easier to have made the proper sacrifices right from the start?I guess we all have to learn are lessons somehow.So today I have a new plan. I will go to university, study, graduate. I will get a job and work very hard. I will become rich. And I will get back the house. And one day, you will walk out of the basement father, and we all be reunited in the sunshine of the courtyard.Until then."
244,Noir at it's best!,YouTubeblack,4 November 2019,10,"I generally never watch foreign language movies because I'm annoyed by the subtitles. But this movie hooks you up to the screen with its visuals, the acting, the premise the shifts in the tone, you never know what's going to happen next. I don't understand Korean but still I could connect and realte to the characters.
After watching Joker, I wasn't expecting any other film this year to even come near it. But this came out like an underdog! Both are 10 on 10 for me.
I wish such movies are made more. I hope it gets a dub so that more people could watch it if they are not into foreign films. This is just gold and a must watch if you like shows like Fargo or even breaking bad, it has a similar aura to it.I literally don't have any major critic for the film but if I have to nitpick, I wish the death of Kim's son was real. Because when it was implied at the beginning that he's dead, but the later on revealed that he survived, takes away the horror of that scene.Overall, It's dark, funny, horror and sometimes feels like it's real, what if you have characters like these in your life too and you just don't know it, how many mask they wear."
245,The Best Original Story of 2019,aboodakram-48692,30 December 2019,10,"Easily, one of the best movies of the year, because of many aspects: First, the acting is awesome, really strong performances by everyone. Second, the story is very interesting. And last but not least, the sequence of events in this movie is one if the year's best. I mean, every act is great on its own, but if you put them all together, you will witness a Masterpiece, and if you watch any of them by itself, you will get an amazing short-film. Considering thd Oscars, this one is a strong nomination for Best Foreign Language Picture and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a nomination for The Best Picture award."
246,Masterpiece,ooohal,16 January 2020,10,"This was one of the most entertaining and enthralling movies I'd seen all year. Everything, from the pacing, filming, characters, story, and dialogue all converge upon the viewer's brain, exciting them neurons like fireworks, bathing our cortices with explosive brain juice! Every scene has a purpose, and builds upon the story, leading up to its climatic ending."
247,Sadistic comedy and brilliant tragedy all bundled up into the best film of 2019.,overlookcinema,12 January 2020,9,"There I said it---It's the best film of the year for this reviewer, and it's the best film Bong Jong-ho has made to date.But to be fair, I've yet to see ""The Irishman,"" ""1917,"" and ""A Hidden Life,"" so my opinion could change. Though, I can't see that being likely.The originalness of ""Parasite"" is what sets it apart. ""Parasite,"" twists and turns to darker and darker places while still maintaining a comedic tone. There's ingenious visual cinematography and storytelling when it portrays the division of class between the wealthy and poor.Class inequality is a theme director Bong Joon-ho frequently uses. You observe it in his other films, ""Snowpiercer,"" ""Okja,"" and even in the first film I ever saw of his back in 2006 with Joon-ho's horror film, ""The Host."" Which also starred Kang-ho Song who plays, Kevin's father in ""Parasite."" He's hilariously witty in both films.""Parasite"" set in South Korea, is about a young man from an impoverished family, the Kims, who winds up with a job to tutor a high school girl from an extremely affluent family, the Parks. He changes his name from Kim Ki-woo to Kevin to impersonate an English tutor. He soon realizes this could be a way to get his whole family employment under the Parks, and the family makes it their plan to do-so.The film shined when it cinematically showed the differences between class equality among these two very different families. When we see the wealthy Park family, the house is pristinely clean. A complete contrast to the Kim family apartment, which is a basement apartment littered with trash and infested by stink bugs, in what looks to be one of the poorest sections of the city.If you like dark comedies, then you're sure to enjoy ""Parasite."" I've witnessed people who don't like foreign films because of subtitle-hatred still relish this film.You won't see another movie like ""Parasite,"" perhaps ever. Well done, Bong Joon-ho."
248,"Good but slightly overrated, in my opinion of course",MatthewKonig,24 January 2021,6,"It was pretty dang good man, I just personally thought it was a bit overrated. Maybe I'm to simple to get the major messages of the film, but hey man, check it out. This movie is a piece of film history."
249,Breathes fresh new life into cinema,williamromano-pugh,11 November 2019,10,"I didn't think I could have my expectations exceeded for this movie, but WOW! Bong Joon Ho really floored me with this one, I tell you what!"
250,WAY OVER RATED,DUTCHY_BOY_1,13 April 2022,6,"This is way way over rated, its a 6 at best. Yes some bits are funny. But others it just drags on. The actings okay. Plots okay. Its just really an okay film overall. Nothing special."
251,Overrated movie.,explusest,28 November 2019,4,Sometimes I really believe people are high when them watch specific kind of movies in festivals.
252,It's restored my faith in film!,toriraphael,18 November 2019,10,"From the beautiful cinematography, blocking, locations to the fantastic acting and screen play it is a must watch movie. This truly original story was a once in a lifetime journey that had me laughing, crying and frighten all in one sitting. Don't take my word for it see it for yourself!"
253,Epicness,Exiled_Jedi,16 January 2020,10,Quick. Metaphorical. Social. Postmodern. Beautiful.You miss if you don't watch it.
254,"Exceptional piece on class, culture, and family.",parrot007,16 January 2020,9,"Watching a movie in another language sometimes creates a barrier, but great film making and writing can instead, turn that into a bridge, and such is one of Parasite's strengths. I never felt out of touch with what was going on because I didn't understand that culture or anything along those lines, and that's why I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
Parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general. Visuals never dissapoint.
The movie is so well paced and gets pretty wild toward the end without being ridiculous. The twists and turns it made were one of the most entertaining Ive seen in a while. There isn't much else to disect. Just go watch it."
255,Simple yet realistic,Nahid_15,12 January 2020,9,"This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and I think the best work of Bong Joon Ho yet. It's a very funny and playful movie. You can't pin it down into one specific genre, much like Bong Joon Ho's other work. Some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense.
The premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life. One day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family. The poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them. Things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously.
What is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic, but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life. The director shows the irony of life. How two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently.
While watching the movie, it was so engaging that I felt like it was controlling me with its beautiful cinematography and well structured plot."
256,PARASITE: OUTSTANDING.,edicionccq,3 January 2020,10,"PROS:EVERY SINGLE THING.The acting is great. The pacing is amazing, it always feels like something is happening and you won't get bored. The message isn't scream out at the audience, you need to read between the lines.
The characters are well developed, there's no hero or villain. You can empathize with every character and understand why they do what they do. There are violence, comedy, action, suspense and romance. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, and I find myself really.CONS:Not for me, but some people may find the ending really weird and unsatisfying. But read some reviews and probably you would understand what's the message behind the ending."
257,Social satire on steroids,mot-stephane,2 June 2019,9,"Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is perfectly written, filmed, and played - a bit too much at times (did we need this Ri Chun-hee's impersonation, or was that a bonus for Western audiences?).No spoilers, but you're forced to understand the gimchi will somehow hit the fan, to want to know, among all possible worst case scenarios, which one will prevail, and to enjoy the ever darker humor first permeating, then overflowing this over the top gem.If this brilliant epic echoes Im Sang-soo's 'The Housemaid' & Kim Ki-duk's '3 iron', Bong remains a league of his own."
258,Overrated,sharifahzahira,14 February 2020,6,"Well, I can't understand how this film defeated The Joker and 1917 at the Oscars.Nice movie, yes, but not spectacular.A lot of plot shortcuts, as if the poor family were world class con artists. So illogical."
259,Story that keeps evolving,mjmaterne,22 September 2019,10,"I might say the titel and the cover seems a bit decieving, it looks more like something for a horror movie but it totally isn't a horror movie. This film just keeps you wondering what will happen and shows a great contrast between the poor and rich. However wrong the path that main character chose, it was really creative.
The plot twist were also very well done and how every part of the movie seemed to fit with each other."
260,Parasite sucks itself dry.,st-shot,13 November 2019,6,"Kim K'atek and his near do well family literally living in the lower depths catches a break when their son obtains employment as a tutor for a wealthy family. Craftily the family conspires to inveigle its way into the household of the Parks by getting the chauffeur and longtime housekeeper fired and setting themselves up inside the lavish domicile with a Garden of Eden for a front yard. Things quickly take a turn however when the housekeeper returns for something she left behind.Working with basically two class defining sets Parasite is a well filmed an interesting watch with the plot slowly unfolding in a darkly comic fashion before going into self induced chaotic free fall from the plausible to the absurd with a hurried climax and unsatisfying epilogue. Director Joon Ho-Bong and cinematographer Kyong pyo Hong do an excellent job of contrasting settings, situations, jabs about class and characters early, equally dividing the roles of his adult characters all benign and petty in their own way. It adds to the fascination of where this slightly off balance plot is going when the wheels come off. With no end game to the plot Ho-Bong decides to end it in conflagration and an insipid post climax that demands it defy logic."
261,mediocre and forgettable,roundtablet,1 December 2019,5,"Parasite is in my opinion a very Korean movie. What do I mean with that? Well, I will get into that late, but firstly; it was directed by Bong Joon-ho, who is best known for his English language movies ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"". Both movies while being overall pretty overdramatic and simple, they at least try to have an atmosphere. They also have a clear message, which however show a very naïve perspective on reality. Even his previous Korean language movies like ""mother"" and ""the host"" are very similar in that fashion. ""Parasite"" however doesn't really show much of that regard. Neither does it have a clear message nor any sort of atmosphere, which in my opinion is very reminiscent of many of the Korean movies I have seen (with the exception of the masterpieces ""Burning"" and ""April snow""). ""Parasite"" however does have an interesting idea behind it which makes it in my opinion the most bearable of the Bong movies. But that's the only thing good about the movie however, maybe besides the production value. The movie has nice set design and has some good shots in it. It is lacking in many other departments however. The characters, for example are terribly written. They are basically shallow and in some cases only 1 dimensional exaggeration of a single character drope making the movie sometimes feeling dragging and boring, because of its focus on the characters. The soundtrack is lacking with only a few classical pieces and they are not really well placed in the movie in order to create atmosphere, often time being played behind dialog conflicting with the exposition scenes (which shows that the production value wasn't well spend in all places). The acting is decent, considering the director. Nothing bad, but also nothing extraordinary. The story consists of many plot conveniences and a lot of shock factor which ruins the whole idea behind it and makes it very confusing.So overall I would say this movie was pretty mediocre, that's why I said its pretty Korean. It had a nice idea but doesn't do much with it and only uses it for shock value. It has very uninteresting character and sometimes feels very boring because of it. It is ultimately a very forgettable movie and the only reason I will probably remember it is because it is overhyped by many (kinda like the Korean movie ""Oldboy"")"
262,A pure masterpiece brilliantly written and directed,kingkongivan,24 August 2019,10,"One thing I always want from a movie is great start and building characters with fun this movie perfectly delivers that while watching you feel like ""yes those peoples are really poor look how they are chasing for a free wifi signal. Movie is fast paced and I quite liked the ending. Surely one of the best movie of this decade"
263,Don't miss this Masterpiece!!!,animesh-14775,28 October 2019,10,"One of the best movies of all time I would say, it's genre bending ranging from funny, suspenseful, thrilling to emotional."
264,Great film great plot,paulmajor-pm,30 December 2019,10,"Best film I've seen in a long while, great plot good twist highly recommended"
265,Entertaining!,omear3265,27 October 2019,10,"A must see if you are tired of endless Hollywood sequels and super hero movies. A can't miss if you are into Quentin Tarantino type of movies (although, without a heroic central character). This is a very entertaining story that's beautifully shot and told with many twist and turns, at a nice and tight pace, from start to finish."
266,Mind-blowing edge of your seat storytelling,santiagofdec,3 January 2020,10,"Such a precise way of unfolding a story, every frame is captivating. Tells the story of social divide in a truly masterful metaphorical thriller with such craft that you can't take your eyes off any single character. Altogether a hitchcokian tale that keeps surprising you with every scene until it's inevitable and explosive third act. I'm in awe of this film."
267,Everything you could ever want in a movie.,rylanprivett,19 November 2019,10,"Went in with little knowledge about this movie. This movie was hilarious, suspenseful, and horrifying. I left the theater with a huge smile on my face. Even if you don't watch foreign films, this should be your exception, because this film is something special."
268,Overrated :(,curtwylde,7 March 2020,6,I don't want to be a troll but this movie is a bit overrated i think. We have much better dramas in Turkish cinema.
269,Extra Ordinary Drama Movie,vishnuashokknightz,26 January 2020,10,"Never Expected this kind of Movie...This movie literally contains all elements.... Brilliant Direction,Music,and acting....Must watch movie"
270,Great Film? Sure. Masterpiece? Not So Fast.,redrobin62-321-207311,5 January 2020,7,"I do recommend this film but it definitely isn't the rip roaring masterpiece you read about comparing it to classics like The Godfather, Casablanca, etc. Why it received so many accolades is beyond me. Probably because it stuck out amongst a sea of mediocre films. The acting was fine. It's the story itself that left a lot to be desired. I really had high hopes going into this one. At least it didn't fall knee deep into the Korean trope of crying crying crying till every handkerchief is dripping wet."
271,Neither fish nor foul,Waedliman,21 June 2020,5,"I am not Korean and maybe I cannot judge every aspect of artistry in this film, beginning with the acting which was a bit shaky for me. In some scenes I saw an actor or actress pretty weak, in the next rather strong. Sometimes I had the feeling they were no professional actors at all. And I can judge acting and I know that that was not on purpose. The camera work was good, I really enjoyed the little details that were presented to my eyes, some misleading, others very clear. Would the storyline have been as thorough as that, this would be a great movie, in my opinion. But it wasn´t. None of the characters was really likeable yet all of them hat their catching moments. The dichotomy of a society, here in lower class people and the rich, worked well yet a little stereotypical. The poor were poor but witty, the rich were super rich but a little stupid or naive. Would the world be a better place if we turned reality upside down? No, it wouldnt, that´s what this film tells us. It´s a satire, of course. For a film that pretends to be on the intellectual side, the violent solution seemed like fraud rather than a well-thought script. Like some others here, I don´t know why this got an Oscar for best movie. Was this another season that was so bad that a movie like this could win?"
272,"Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for this tour de force masterpiece!!!!",sumeerm-18507,9 November 2019,10,"PARASITE
Directed by Bong Joon-Ho
How often does one get the opportunity to see a film, on the silver screen, which leaves you enriched by the immaculate craft of the filmmaker's original voice and style of storytelling? How often does a movie leave you inspired to just grab a stack of paper and a pen, and begin writing your very own story? Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite is definitely one of those movies which left me moved and inspired. It's one of those movies which beautifully broadened my view towards the world. This film tackles social issues in a visually visceral and cinematic manner; it doesn't rely on preachy monologues and melodramatic action to convey its underlying themes of class discrimination, greed, family, and morality. Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, craft the screenplay in a subtle style in order to convey the social issues that are revolving around the film.
Parasite tells the story of the Kim family, which is made of four individuals: a father, a mother, a teenage boy, and a teenage girl. This family takes interest in the Park family, who are incredibly rich and wealthy, when the teenage boy, played exceptionally by Choi Woo-shik, takes over his friend's job as an English tutor for the daughter of the Park family, who is a sophomore in high school. The film proceeds with the Kim family obtaining the various jobs around the house of the Park family, who are unaware of this. From there one, Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, tell a beautiful story of family, class discrimination, empathy, and morality in a satirical and dark manner.
Parasite embodies a countless number of flawless moments of storytelling, which can leave one entertained, thrilled, and moved. Bong Joon-Ho utilizes visual storytelling to not only heighten the thrills, but using minute details to depict the discriminations that are made between the rich and the poor. There are two scenes which depict the way the rich and the poor perceive heavy rainfalls. The Park family are enamored by the sight and scenery of the rain from their window. Whereas the Kim family, struggle to grab their personal belongings due to their basement apartment being flooded by the rainfall. Yang Jin-mo's editing immerses the viewer in these visually engaging scenes. There is one moment where she uses the shot of the overflowing water transitioning to a bird-eye shot of the Kim family and their neighbors struggling to take the water out of their homes by using buckets. This is what makes Parasite shine as this visual experience, where we as an audience, understand both sides of the coin. The audience is able to grasp a sense of the struggles that the poor have to face, and this is done with incredible cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo.
The performances of Parasite are incredible. Each actor provides a nuanced and authentic performance; they faithfully portray the psychology of their characters. Another incredibly refreshing aspect of this film was how Bong Joon-ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, portray the Park family. They aren't portrayed as stingy rich people, they are kind, caring, and naïve. They are naïve to the point where they are baffled by the smell of a poor individual. Bong Joon-ho authentically depicts the humanity of both the wealthy and impoverished characters of the film. The way the characters are crafted and portrayed is what allows the film to augment Bong Joon-ho's original voice as a storyteller.
Parasite is not only the best film I have seen this year; it is the best film I have seen this decade. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for crafting a tour de force of a film. Thank you for reassuring me, as an aspiring storyteller, that stories build bridges of unity. Thank you of inspiring me to write a story that is original and deeply resonates with my memory and my heart. As the great Japanese filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once said, ""If you genuinely want to make movies, start writing screenplays. Take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write, write, and write."" Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece, Parasite, inspired me to go home and take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write the stories I want to tell. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for shrewdly crafting a masterpiece that beautifully depicts the themes of class discrimination and filiality."
273,A brilliant masterpiece!,amitc-48998,12 January 2020,10,"One of the best films of the decade. It has it all: amazing cast, great music, cinematography, genius writing and direction. And most important, it's thought provoking. A philosophical piece about where moral stands in life of survival, about the ascend to happiness and the descend that reminds you money isn't everything. The characters so complex yet so simple and delivered with brilliant acting. Bong joon-ho has proven to be one of the best filmmakers working today."

276,Stuck at the bottom,evanf44,12 January 2020,10,"So much to unpack. incredibly thoughtful and clean cinematography. Well written script. Masterful suspense, so many metaphors! the music in the suspenseful scenes was so good that you barely noticed it until it was over. I was captivated through the whole movie.I thought that there might be some symbolism of North Korea/South Korea as well as social class, but I haven't seen anyone else point that out, so it could be me grasping at straws.For the main family, the film ends in essentially the same situation as it began, minus the father and daughter. Ki-Woo and Chung-Sook are presumably still struggling, at the bottom of the stairs again. Everything that happened in the film did nothing but take half of the family away. Thus describes Bong Joon-Ho's ruthless realism; the poor get poorer, and life continues on with no plan to fix anything.Not that that matters, it wouldn't work anyway."

279,Parasite (Spoiler Free),brodysmatthews-84808,13 January 2020,10,"Last night was one of the most thrilling experiences I have had watching a film..I attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house. I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.As I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year.The first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining. Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen.Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.Grade- A+Brody's TAKE 5"
280,Almost Great Besides Dumb Ending,oppaimauspad,14 January 2021,6,"What's funny is that the parasites in Hollywood loved this film because they actually sided with the scumbag poor family.When the point of the film is that they get biblically punished by a flood for acting like demons. That scene where she's smoking a cigarette on the toilet is powerful.Although, much like Hitchcock taking it one twist too far at the very end of Vertigo, the poor dad killing the rich dad at the end felt totally undeserved. It wasn't built up to properly. It felt like the director just wanted to get to that point but the pieces weren't placed to justify it, for the audience or the character.If your DAUGHTER just got murdered by a fellow poor person why would your immediate reaction be to empathize with the plight of the DAUGHTER KILLER as inspiration for killing the rich guy COMPLETELY OUT OF LEFT FIELD. Sure the rich guy called him smelly and sure he was resentful towards him, but to murder him in front of everyone just read as extremely false and dumb.I don't believe actual poor people would even like or empathize with this ending. This is purely a trashy parasitical rich person's fantasy.It's a shame the ending was so stupid because up until then it was a pretty darn good flick."
281,Extremely over-rated movie,jethronom,26 January 2020,3,"After watching the movie I checked IMDB score.There should be some kind of Korean Film Maffia or IMDB Trolls who voted with high score.A complete nonsense.After a hour, you start to look at the screen and say ""WHY?"".All nonsense movies gets some award from the festival juries. I think they may wanna show off something like ""we understood the sarcasm but you don't""."
282,"This is to all the people giving low ratings and saying the plot is ""unbelievable""...",gimkenny,30 October 2019,10,"THATS THE WHOLE POINT!
ive seen some reviewers here say that the poor family infiltrating the rich family so easily and skillfully felt like a ""feel good movie"" to let us root for the underdog people and cheer for them when they succeed... the directer clearly intentionally led the plot to be such... so when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morallity of the rich and poor families.. Are the rich really ""evil"" for ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them? How people dont get the point of social commentary and only focuses on plot details and improbablity is just sad.."
283,"""If you make a plan, life never works out that way.""",classicsoncall,26 January 2020,8,"This film's ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly. Usually, when a hot new release makes it's way into the Top 250, it manages to remain in it's general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote. ""Parasite"" entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall, and since then has managed to improve it's position to #26 as I write this. No one knows if that will hold obviously, so I'm curious to see how the movie rates over time.Having stated that, I thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the Kim family maneuver it's way into the life and home of the Park family. What was questionable to me was why the Kim's weren't able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when Min (Seo-joon Park) suggested the tutoring job to Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi). Each of the Kim's demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long. It's not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition, because once that ambition kicked into gear, there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the Park's. Not that it wasn't done by underhanded or devious means, but with those kinds of street smarts, they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood. But that was the set up, so you have to go with it.Where the story begins to go off the rails is when the Kim's luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak. Personally, I would never have allowed the former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) unescorted access to the Park home when she came calling to rescue her husband. Though it revealed the hidden areas of the Park home, they would have been discovered by the Kim's had they followed and observed Moon-gwang to begin with. Instead, the lapse in judgment allowed for a potential escape and as it turned out, a blackmail attempt that would have fired all the Kim's from their lucrative positions.I have to admit, I was somewhat baffled by Mr. Kim's (Kang-ho Song) stabbing of Park Dong-ik (Sun-kyun Lee), but reading some of the more thoughtful reviews here helped put that into perspective. I can't say that I agree wholeheartedly, but at least the reasons offer some semblance of a motive, all revolving around the idea of 'crossing the line' that the Kim's were guilty of. Even so, by giving the story a Tarantino-esque spin for it's denouement was going more than a bit over the top. And to venture even further into the realm of unreality, Ki-woo's survival after getting smacked in the head by a twenty pound landscape stone, not once but twice!, was entirely incomprehensible to this viewer.As for the ultimate finale, who's to say that Kim-woo's plan to rescue his dad wasn't a viable one - grow up, get rich and buy the house! Good luck with that idea, because in the very words of Mr. Kim himself - """"If you make a plan, life never works out that way"". And on top of that, it would be a decade long mission at the very least. In the final analysis, if the story had kept on track with the devious infiltration into the lives of the Park's, I could envision a scenario in which the parasites might have eventually dominated their hosts in their own home. But it didn't turn out that way, and as a result, I think it misses the mark as the year's Best Picture at the Oscars.Addendum**** 2-10-2020 - Well, I'm not embarrassed to admit I was wrong about the picture's chances at the Oscars. It won 'Best Picture' last night in a pretty competitive field. Congratulations!"
284,So many twists and turns I got whiplash,admichalk,11 January 2020,9,"I thought I knew what was happening but it turns out I didnt even know what I didnt know.
Cinematography was so well done. Comedy relief at the exact moments it needed it. My stress levels at a max the entire last quarter I had to physically cover my gaping mouth with my hand."
285,A masterful emotional rollercoaster,CriticalOfEverything,16 January 2020,10,"Bong Joon-Ho is an outstanding director, and this might be his best work yet. Parasite is one of the best movies of the entire decade, hell I'd go as far as saying no other movie this decade quite matches it. It's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's intense. It does all of this while not feeling tonally inconsistent or confused, which is something that many films fail to do. The acting is incredible and the characters themselves are fantastic, with no good guys or bad guys: They're people. They feel like real and believable characters, which is such a refreshing change of pace from all of the bloated action movies that we get every year. It's well shot, as to be expected, and the social commentary is fantastic.This is the first movie I've seen in the longest time that I can describe as perfect, I loved every single bit of it."
286,too much great,guillevica,19 January 2020,9,"This movie has 2 parts, the first one a kind of comedy, but too much smart, and the second is a complete tragedy,

288,Entertaining and shocking twists,hanalisss,9 November 2023,7,"Parasite stands as a cinematic tour de force, a film that transcends genres and defies easy categorization. Bong Joon-ho's directorial brilliance is on full display in this Korean masterpiece, a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of class divisions that seamlessly weaves together dark humor, suspense, and social commentary.From the opening scenes, it captivates with its meticulous attention to detail and visual storytelling. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is nothing short of breathtaking, capturing the stark contrast between the cramped living conditions of the Kim family and the opulent luxury of the Park residence. Each frame is a visual feast, contributing to the film's immersive experience.The narrative unfolds with a gripping precision, as the Kim family, struggling in the lower echelons of society, cunningly infiltrates the lives of the wealthy Park family. The plot twists and turns with a surprising and relentless momentum, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. Bong Joon-ho's screenplay is a work of art, seamlessly blending elements of comedy, drama, and thriller into a cohesive and engaging story.Central to the film's success are the stellar performances from the cast. Song Kang-ho leads with a nuanced portrayal of the patriarch, Kim Ki-taek, navigating the complexities of his character with finesse. The entire ensemble, including Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, and Lee Sun-kyun, deliver performances that breathe life into their multifaceted roles, creating a palpable on-screen chemistry.The movie is more than just a suspenseful thriller; it's a profound commentary on societal inequality. Bong Joon-ho skillfully uses the Kim family's strategic infiltration of the Park household as a lens through which to examine the stark contrasts between the haves and the have-nots. The film prompts viewers to reflect on the systemic issues of class disparity and the lengths individuals may go to escape the constraints of poverty.Beyond its social commentary, it also explores the universality of human desires and the consequences of unchecked ambition. The characters, while navigating their respective socio-economic challenges, grapple with themes of morality, identity, and the pursuit of a better life.In conclusion, this is a cinematic triumph, a film that not only entertains but also challenges and provokes thought. Bong Joon-ho's masterful direction, coupled with outstanding performances and a richly layered narrative, makes it a standout in contemporary cinema. This Korean gem deserves every accolade it has received, marking a pivotal moment in the global recognition of the richness and depth of Korean filmmaking."

290,Not that good,TdSmth5,13 September 2020,6,"The Kims are a struggling lower class family. One day the son gets an opportunity from a friend. He also gets some good-luck rock from him that will lay a role later in the film. He can work as an English tutor for a rich family. His sister forges a bunch of documents for him so he appears US educated. He gets the job and starts a relationship with the his tutee. The rich family lives in an amazing mansion built by some famous architect. The wife is naive and lives in materialism. The father, a famous arrogant musician, isn't home much but there he is worshiped. They also have a young son who is trouble, as all kids that age. But the mother acts overwhelmed and thinks he's some kind of painter prodigy. That gives the tutor a chance to get his sister hired as an ""art therapist"" for the troubled son. So the sister impersonates an art therapist. When she's meets the chauffeur she devises a way to get him fired and her dad hired instead.Now they all figure out a way to get rid of the housekeeper. They succeed. When the Parks leave for a weekend, the Kims celebrate in the mansion. Then the former housekeeper shows up. She reveals that there is a secret basement where she's been keeping her husband and begs mother Kim to take care of him in exchange for money. Then the entire Kim family falls literally to the ground in front of the housekeeper and this the entire scam is revealed to her. She takes some video. The families fight over the video. Then mother Park calls announcing that they will return home soon. The Kims hide under the living room table. The old housekeeper fell down the basement stairs and is seriously injured. Her husband is bound back in his basement room.Eventually the Kims escape as the Parks actually decide to sleep in the living room. There's heavy rain and their humble basement home has been flooded. Then they get a call from the Parks to help them for a birthday party for the son next day. In the middle of the party, the housekeeper's husband has freed himself. and takes his revenge by smashing son Kim's head in with his good luck rock, then attacks daughter Kim with a knife. Father Park has repeatedly complained about the smell of the Kims. That leads father Kim to attack Park after he's taken care of the housekeeper's husband.Parasite is a horror comedy of sorts that shows the stark contrast between the poor working/scheming family and the wealthy/naive family whose ""problems"" are mostly blown up minor issues. The characters are slightly cartoonish. Things are somewhat enjoyable for 2/3rds of the movie. You do end up rooting for the Kims. The bizarre and unlikely appearance of the housekeeper and her husband change the tone of the movie and for the worse. It also disrupts the movie too much and it doesn't recover. From then on you know and expect something you happen, you just don't know from which direction it will come. In the end it's somewhat of a surprise but it doesn't amount to much really.Sure, economic class is an issue here but the story is covered in satire and humor, no doubt to make a serious issue more palatable, thus diluting whatever serious issue is being addressed. It's not so much about class warfare but rather codependency. As with any codependent relationship, there are pet peeves and unaddressed grievances and resentments. But there is no major message in the movie. It could have don't more with the theme but it went for an easy solution, one that doesn't solve anything."
291,Overrated,jaindikshant,3 June 2020,4,"In my opinion this movie is overrated. Because of the rating i watched this movie but there is not good as rating.

292,WOW.,geraldscott-61633,17 January 2020,10,Just WOW. I loved every second of this film. The cinematography is on point! Such a beautiful film and such a great plot! Go see this movie!!
293,Family Affairs,EdgarST,5 December 2019,10,"Winner of the Palme d'Or for Best Film in Cannes 2019, to say «Parasite» is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament. When you have to spill blood in a film, you have to dose it with genius, hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and, above all, understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well.Don't get me wrong «Parasites» is not a bloody drama, but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art: it is a tragicomedy about love, life and death, it is a film about the joy of living, about survival, about the family of the 21st century, but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many, that sick, stifled definition, confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values. It is about real and living families of the planet in 2019, many dispossessed and a few privileged, in a game of services and currency exchanges, in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence, horror and death.Although director Bong Joon-ho has already made about ten feature films of various themes, I only know one of his films, the cult fable «The Guest», a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of Seoul, that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the Han River by an American scientist, kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus. Again, in «Parasite», Bong addresses the family issue, opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children, to a rich family with the same number of members. The moment they cross roads is the basis of the story. A third component, personified by a housekeeper, gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax, which is not the end of the fascinating story; at this point of the story, it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell, until the sad final close-up that ends this work.When I watch films like ""Parasites"" my heart skips a beat, I wish that people would have access to a wide and cultured film offer, that we all could see works like this instead of consuming the despicable L.A. garbage that the cinemas offer, week after week, freezing the reasoning of people from the whole world; or having to wait for an exclusive film festival to project them fleetingly, and to be subject to serials of thrones and other lousy dishes. As soon as «Parasite» appears through any of the windows we have today to watch movies, don't miss it."
294,Amazing,qtrn-11972,17 January 2020,10,"First off, I feel like you either get this movie or you don't, that simple. There Is so much thought provoking duality that comes into play, those who rate it poorly seem to miss this part of the story. I don't want to give spoilers but if you truly allow yourself to go on the emotional roller coaster that this movie is, it will leave you thinking about all the twists and turns for days."

297,First Hit: I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd.,michaeldoud,12 October 2019,10,"First Hit: I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd.We are introduced to this South Korean family (the Kim family) as they are getting ready to eat. The below ground level home has few street-level windows as they look up from the table to see a drunk young man peeing on a wall near their home.We can tell the family is barely making it financially from the looks of the room, the view outside the room, and by their sparse, cryptic, and entertaining conversation. However, they seem to be engaged in their lives and hopeful because they are talking about the language of scheme making.The family consists of the father Ki-taek (played by Song Kang-ho), the mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and the daughter Ki-woo (Park So-dam).Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon) comes by their home, wanting to give Ki-woo a present. It is a rock sculpture that is supposed to bring economic well-being. Because Min-hyuk has to leave town for a while, he tells Ki-woo about a tutoring gig he wants him to take over while he's gone. The subject of his tutoring is a rich high school girl named Park Dye-hye (Jung Ji-so). Dye-hye's mother, Park Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong), Min-hyuk says, isn't too bright, so he should easily pass the interview. Ki-woo expresses his worries that he'll be found out and may not be good enough, but Min-hyuk assures him that even though he's only got a high school education, he'll dazzle the ditzy Mrs. Park.When asking Min-hyuk why he's giving him this offer, Min-hyuk explains that he didn't want one of his college friends doing the gig because he loves this girl, wants to date her when she's out of high school and knows that Ki-woo is a true friend and wouldn't cross him in this way.Arriving at the Park home, he's let in by the housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun). Walking through the house, he's amazed at what a sizeable beautiful home it is. It's very modern and filled with all the luxuries he's never known and only dreamed about. The interview with Mrs. Park goes very well, and he's hired to tutor Dye-hye. Noticing artwork around the home, he asks about it. The mother explains that it is her wild son who shoots bows and arrows around the house. But he's also an artist and Mrs. Park thinks her son could be compared to the Andy Warhol anointed artist Jean-Michael Basquiat.Seeing an opportunity and because the family is wealthy and pays well, he says he may know of a young woman who is an Art Therapist that could work with the boy to become a great artist. Getting home, he tells his family about this and his sister is ready to do her part and take on a new role as Art Teacher and Therapist.I'll leave the rest to your imagination, but let's just say the family all participates in this adventure.But when the wealthy family takes a camping vacation, and the old housekeeper comes to collect something she left behind, the whole story starts to turn towards the macabre.Parasite is a perfect name for the film, and it is not easy to pin down all the aspects this film offers the viewer. As it won the Cannes Palme d'Or for best film and I can see why.Song, as the patriarch of the Kim family, was exquisite in embodying this character. Early in the film, when he announces that they need to leave the windows open when the street fumigators come down the street, I knew I was in for a ride. It was perfect for setting up his mindset. His silent looks while driving Mr. Park around after he learns that the Park's think he and his family smell, are spot on. Jo was excellent as Mrs. Park. Her expressions when buying into the stories shared Ki-woo and Ki-jung were priceless. She was the perfect foil and focal point of the Park family. Choi was terrific as the Kim family young man. His wistful story at the end of the film about finding his father was excellent. Park was sublime as the Kim family daughter turned instant Art Therapist. Her embodying the story she made up for herself was funny, engaging, and perfect. Jang, as mother to the Kim children, made me laugh. Her actions and responses during the opening scenes while the family was eating were scene-stealing. Lee Sun-kyun was outstanding as Mr. Park. His command of the family as he waltzed in from work was evident and clearly identified who was in charge of the Park family. Lee Jung-eun, as the housemaid for the Park family, was engaging. Her arriving back to collect what she left in the basement under the kitchen opened the door for the film to move to another level. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won wrote a wildly entertaining screenplay that had both funny and dark edges. Joon-ho was outstanding directing this film. Some of the shots, especially as the family tried to get back home during a major storm, told much of the story. The direct downward view of the slums in which they lived, being flooded, was telling. Just as the shots of the luxurious home where they worked were just the opposite; clean, crisp, and wonderfully shot with various angles.Overall: This is a contender for Best Foreign Film and maybe even Best Picture."
298,Ok I guess...,felipefran13,2 January 2022,6,"This film is an ok film. It has some funny moments, some agony moments and a little drama. I can't say I had a hard time watching it. But I really can't understand how people lost their minds. The poor family with all these lies get a very nice job with good money. Yet they still don't move out from the basement, they decide to continue living in there and not moving out to start living a better life. They even throw a party to the mansion and thinking how they can take more from the rich. So am I supposed to feel sorry for them at the end? The movie doesn't imply that the rich family are greedy or they stole money from others for themselves. Mr Park seem to working pretty hard to be in that position and to earn his money. They pay well the working staff and even extra is some occasions. Of course they seem to be discussed by the poor but they don't offend them in any way throughout the film. So to me they are more ""likeable"" than the poor family. Overall is a good movie but that's it. I literally don't understand the hype."
299,MUST MUST MUST SEE!,dannypetty-73316,25 August 2019,10,"I don't often give a 10 but I simply have no complaints. This was an enthralling watch - even as I watched it with the subtitles! So smart. There were many angles and I'm not sure what the genre is. First the humour got me, then the characters got me, then the main plot got me, then the drama got me, the sadness got me and the horror got me. So entertaining, eyes peeled kind of stuff. You have no idea where its going to go. I found myself really rooting for the main characters and the topics are so relevant. Korean cinema - i am watching out for gems like this. Really, a clever, entertaining brilliant film. Watch it."
300,Creditable: its good but not great,sy-88345,19 March 2020,7,"This doesn't seem like an oscar - winning picture. There is no doubt of the good acting delivered by the actors ; each characters has its own personality and the plot is twisting enough. The whole story is quite metaphoric,hinting the notion of class struggle. However , in my opinion I think the metaphors are too explicit and at the same time can be disturbing.
It just ain't oscar- wrothy!"
301,A Titanic achievement,balgarnie,28 December 2019,3,"Richly appointed, a glitterati champagne Cannes launch to an inebriated fanfare of stratospheric expectation, then unexpectedly in mid-journey an iceberg crash, an unsettling sinking feeling, followed by an agonizingly slow cascade into drowning horror.
Compared to another mediocre superhero movie it might rank favourably, but a far cry from Tati or Hitchcock. Closer to a stylish 70s exploitation film."
302,It's extremely hard to get a 10/10 from me.,brideaujeremy,2 September 2019,10,Korean film makers literally have such a interesting mind. Absolutely unique and a film I'll never forget!
303,A little fantastical journey that reflects the harsh and unfortunate reality.,abasu0819,29 January 2020,10,"The dark satirical thriller, directed by Bong Joon-ho, began in a very scampering fashion with the mention of the word ""metaphor"" for countless amount of time. And as you'd usually expect from a Bong film, the metaphor then played a key role throughout yhe film as the name - ""Parasite"" - suggests. Though, it depends on how you take it & what you'd like to call it because ""stairway"" remains as another option as well. How? That's the beauty of this two hour long flick. Why? Let's discuss!And to begin with, there's the plot that on paper didn't particularly make a lot of sense as it's expected from a satire in general. But the layers beneath and the sui generis usage of the metaphor illustrated the beauty, giving the film a base to build upon. No matter how unrealistic and chaotic the occuring events were, the joyousness kept emanating throughout while keeping a lot of space for sympathy and questions in a sublime pace and lighthearted tone initially. Supported by a colourful yet limited and very important cast with a lot of depth. Each and every actors, in their respective roles, probably have outdone themselves in that regard.On a technical note, the cinematography in particular, deserves a lot of credits. Hong Kyung-pyo managed to capture the essence of two types of Korea, something which was extremely important for the film in itself, while keeping everything so simplistic and relatable. The entire set-up of the film, that provided the innocence and realistic touch, deserves a lot of extolling. At the end, the editing acted as needle that knitted everything together. Supervised by CJ Productions (and of course, Bong) with a tight budget, it'd be totally unfair not to mention how impressed I've been by their mind-blowing piece of work.But everything aside, what packs the ultimate punch? The theme of differences of classes and how it's showcased through the ""stairways."" Call it pessimistic as you may like, or realistic for the sake of argument, the harsh reality doesn't change. That said, do you stop dreaming? No. But sometimes you get carried away in the sea of hopes, which may be ""greed"" for many. The dependency on lower classes & prison of wealth is something the film depicts so very uniquely. And the ending eventually solidified whatever, pessimistic for some and realistic for many, Bong wanted to claim; or rather ask you. With a lot of differences of opinions on its simplistic yet so complicated ending scene, one thing remains certain - you're bound to fall in love with this masterpiece, that sure does have the potential to snatch the ""Best Picture"" award at the gala night of Academy Awards 2020!"
304,A Powerful Masterpiece!,redkyng,1 October 2019,10,"It's hard to describe this movie, i will just say this is a critical point of view about the modern family and society. The transformation from a light comedy to a strange disturbing and a violent movie is unbelievable..... the party scene is a beautiful philosophical portrait about humans, this is truly a Powerful masterpiece."
305,A masterpiece,fabriziodivariart,23 October 2019,10,"Finally a masterpiece. It has been some time since I watched suck a brilliant movie. Put it simply, everything about it is perfect. The story, the acting, the cinematography, the score...and the amazingly beautiful end. Applauses!!"
306,BIGGEST RIDE OF 2019,bryanberrios96,21 October 2019,10,Despite being incredibly edited and filmed. Beautiful dark cinematography. This movie takes you on a full on ride that no one is waiting for. The surprise factor and the randomness of the situations just keep adding up none stop. With a break point that leaves you with that empty feeling that something just ducked your soul and destroyed you inside but at the same time made you laugh and stay on deep silence to just digest.Starting of by showcasing extremely complex characters you already know that you signed up for something entirely unusual. Lies and desperation can lead to absolute apocalypse. Every single scene adds to the story but it also makes it more twisted and complicated.Do yourself a favor and watch this film.
307,Truly masterful film mixed with metaphors galore.,YourAverageReviewer,14 November 2019,10,"This is something that stays with you for life. Whether good or bad, it shows it. Never have I seen a movie about classic stereotypes and used them in such a creative way that it's almost something entirely different.Anxiety is something I'd define this movie as. It's edge of your seat, heart in your stomach and hoping. Then it happens."
308,Not the best movie of the director,DansLeNoir,2 April 2020,No rating,"The fourth movie I watched from the director. Gwoemul is still in the best movies I've watched. Although the subject of the movie in general was ordinary, it was fun to watch half the movie, other half bothered a little. I like it even though it can't give the effect I expected at the end. Acting and script were nice. Social messages were sufficient again. I like the movie but Gwoemul still best for me!"

But maybe it´s only me, I can´t make out a plot that ties all together, unfortunately. So it remains a bunch of snipets, greatly shot clips, but the story loses itself if not in the worst of all, in oceandeep hopelessness, it is the saddest experience leaving the theatre. 9 for the pictures, 1 for the story. sorry no."

Every celebrity, message board poster and even the former President of the United States Obama are saying this was the best movie of the year.It's just not good! Why is this being considered one of the best of the year? I'm totally lost. This is one of the most forgettable movies I have ever seen. To put it bluntly, even Michael Bay's worst Transformers movie is better than this dreck.I came into this movie thinking it was going to be the next City of God based on the hype. It's actually on the level of a movie on Netflix that I'd spend five minutes on before skipping to the next film and clicking ""thumbs down.""Don't waste your time, trust me on this.I forgot to add, it's very obvious that whoever made this movie ripped off Shameless in many ways. They were definitely inspired by it."
313,A commedy/horror/thriller Makjang !!!,Hope-Earl,24 August 2019,10,Best movie of 2019. I am in awe. In fact it's one the best movies i have ever seen in my life. What a masterpiece no wonder it won the top award at the cannes film festival. You can never guess what is going to happen next or how it will end. Damn !! Wow and it begs the question who is the victim here?
314,Amazing,noza43536,20 January 2020,10,"The best movie l've seen! I wanna see it again!
You mast see!"
315,Poverty,stoneps,17 January 2020,8,"I guess people can never fully understand poverty and what it can do to people. This is a very very powerful film. Very clever. But even this film can't depict the real poverty. If you've watched it and are reading this very review, you ain't poor. The real poor don't watch this film. This film might have depicted struggles. But real life is on another level.And no I don't know what it's like either. But I can get a good taste of that idea when seeing the predators in the wild showing that numb gaze when they bites the neck of their prey. On their fierce face I don't see any extra thoughts. No concerns about ethnicity, pain or morality. But the absolute focus to end this hunt as quick as possible so that it could become dinner.There isn't any flamboyance in that. There is only straight up desire. And the feed for that desire."
316,My god,aboyle-67994,16 January 2020,10,Far and away one of the best films you'll ever see.
317,This One is a Game-Changer,jacob-scheer90,10 February 2020,10,"In 2006, when I went to an art house movie theater, I saw Bong Joon Ho's campy but awesome sci-fi horror monster movie ""The Host."" I was only 16, but I made sure from then on I would see all the things he directs.When he began getting so much praise and attention in 2019 for ""Parasite,"" I was a little worried. I wasn't a fan of ""Snowpiercer"" (although it is well crafted), and when he worked with Netflix in 2017 to direct ""Okja,"" I was even more disappointed.But this afternoon, with my parents, I saw ""Parasite"" at Cinemark before the Oscars. As my previous review of it says, it is now one of my all time favorite films I've ever seen. I figured, however, given the Academy's fancy for war films, I just knew ""1917"" would take home the award for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and in all fairness, that was an amazing film. When Jane Fonda opened the envelope and stared for a moment, I was worried that the one film I wasn't terribly impressed with, ""Ford v. Ferrari,"" was the winner. Again, that was a technical feat for sure, but in my book it was the only one nominated for the best pic category that I felt it didn't deserve the win.Jane Fonda, with surprised grandness (and obvious shock), announced that one word: ""Parasite."" There are many films that have won Best Picture that I've gushed over (remember my obsession with ""The Shape of Water""?), but this announcement made my heart leap with elation; that same sensation you get when your crush kisses your cheek and whispers ""I like you too.""Bong Joon Ho...I am so happy for you."
318,AMAZING IT'S INSANE,simon_simpan18,2 February 2020,10,"This is my first ever review. I saw it with my sister at the movie theatre. I never wanted to know anything about the movie in before hand and I've scouted the movie for a long time.
Among the best movies I've ever seen. We were both laughing many times, even the slap stick could be funny. I had real hand sweat during scenes.
The filming techniques are superb and a scene fade I've never seen before, gave me goosebumps. I like all the characters. Even though they are disgusting.
I will see it again, Korean movies is something else, I love them."
319,What just happened in the last 30 minutes,oazoozx,7 March 2020,7,Literally the movie was good until the last 30 minutes were literally nothing main sense !!
320,"Suspenseful, thrilling and lots of fun!",ola-riser,3 February 2020,10,"After this movie, I'm now ready to search Craigslist for available jobs for me, my friends and my family.
I'm also gonna build myself a bunker."

323,"Great film, great filmmaker.",iambrdy,5 February 2020,9,"I've loved every film of Bong Joon Ho's that I've scene dating back to the Host. One of the premier auteurs of our generation. This film did what so few films do in our current era, it genuinely surprised. The film is as authentically original and inspired as people are saying it is.Loved it."
324,Amazing,naomichar,1 February 2020,10,"This movie shows exactly how it is to live in a country full of structural violence.
It shows perfectly the desperation of people in need to have a better life."
325,Breathtaking story of pretending,zorgmauth,1 February 2020,9,"The movie starts slowly and shows us who the family lives. Despite the unmoral functioning of the family, that pretend to be someone their not to their benefict, after the major plot twist in the midle of film, the tension dont stop rising and the ansiety keeps increasing until a crazy final conflict. The resolution of the final dont explain to much but have satisfied me."
326,Instant legend,deriantt,2 February 2020,10,"The movie was excellent in combining multiple genres like comedy, thriller & drama which is difficult to pull off. It definitely stood out of mass movie productions with its story, characters & plot twists.Parasite has couple of things in its story which left question marks in my mind, but didn't effect it negatively.My 10/10 is weighted by the fact that this kind of movie is very rare and the originality of the story leaves the viewer almost constantly surprised by the next turn of events."
327,Politico-social commentary does not get any better!!!,rohitrawat-41842,3 February 2020,10,What can one not love about this movie...the movie operates at so many layers of metaphors and ironies...the best that has come out of South Korea till date...expect some fireworks this Oscar season...#Bonghivethe movie basically portrays class divide in South Korea and symbiotic relationship between a rich and a poor family...the rich family is the proverbial host whereas the poor family...the Parasite!!!The beauty of the movie lies a few layers beneath what is actually portrayed...how the parasite slowly befriends the host...and how it gradually morphs into something else completely...think of all the plot twists and their manifestations in society...specifically the relationship between the owner and the working class...just brings out global sentiments of Capitalism going crazy so beautifully!!!As this movie is being released globally...I am sure the rankings and ratings will further improve...it was released in India around 1st Feb...this movie is a global phenomena considering the times we live in...Recommended...just go and watch this in your nearest theatre!!!
328,Beautiful Masterpiece,sutaunrac,4 February 2020,10,"I just want to leave my opinion on this masterpiece, I love films from South Korea, and what makes me love them even more are these films that leave me thinking for three days in a row, the fact that the film always has several meanings and is brilliant I love the fact that every little detail always has a meaning, they are films like these with symbolism, mystery and messages to make the audience think that they are the best films for me!"
329,It's fine. I just didn't think it was as great as everyone else seems to think.,markgorman,24 February 2020,7,"I am going to be unpopular here because it's unfashionable to do anything other than laud Parasite from the rooftops.Let's get a couple of things straight before the off.I have no issue with the 'One inch barriers"" to universal film appreciation that director Bong Joon Ho describes subtitles as. I have seen thousands of subtitled movies and Scandi Noirs.I have no, unlike Mr Trump, political bias against (sorry, not bias, prejudice in Trump's case) South Korean cinema. Indeed I recently reviewed Chan Wook-Park's The Handmaiden as 10 stars on IMDB. (Oldboy is a classic from Park, too.)I also loved Ho's Okja and The Host, although I thought his English-speaking Snowpiercer was truly awful.So this is not the problem, and just because I'm not raving about this doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, I did. I just feel the praise that's being lavished upon it is greater than my appreciation.I read one review on IMDB by 'mysticfall' that suggested anyone who didn't love this was a moron and clearly didn't understand it.I had no issue with understanding it.It's essentially a movie about class and privilege in which Ho brings together South Korea's richest and poorest in one household, with the poorest as servants, and sets up a scenario where he does not judge either for their caste.Except he does.As the film progresses it's clear that the master of the house has an ingrained prejudice against the poor that manifests itself in his inability to understand or articulate that it's their 'smell' that reeks of poverty, and is therefore undesirable.Variously described as a comedy and horror it leans far more to the former with some extremely funny lines and a pretty strong dose of slapstick - as seen in Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's excellent Inside Number 9 episode - A Quiet Night In in which two cat-burglars attempt to steal paintings from an occupied house without a word of dialogue.Almost all of Act 2 of Parasite was essentially this episode.The horror that we are promised is actually gore, and is reserved for Act 3. It's very much in the school of Tarantino, and, of course, Tarantino himself is heavily influenced by Asian film-making, so a certain circle is squared.The performances are universally excellent but I feel that, on occasion, Ho strays into slightly heavy-handed territory - much in evidence in his direction of Snowpiercer. It's not enough to spoil anything, but it clashes with the adulatory reviews I've read.The cinematography is simply beautiful.It's a fine movie, but in my view 1917 was a more immersive cinematic experience and consequently deserved the Best Picture Academy Award.Call me what you like, but I'm saying what I'm seeing."
330,Best movie of the 2010s!,etzelryan76,3 February 2020,10,"Fascinating cinema that highlights how emotionally detached wealthy people can be. So many profound messages as it pertains to classism. Unexpected plot twists and all. I loved, loved, loved this movie."
331,The Prince and the Pauper ........ I've seen this scenario play out a few times before,Ed-Shullivan,16 November 2020,6,"Mrs. Shullivan and I finally decided to sit down and read (English sub-titles) this 2020 Academy Award Best Picture winner and both of us felt it was decent enough, but to win ""Best Picture"" against a great film like ""Once Upon a Time In Hollywood"" I think director Quentin Tarantino was absolutely robbed. I guess when the USA is losing a lot of its film credibility with powerhouse producers such as Harvey Weinstein finally being put behind bars and the decades old USA social justice upheavel the Academy felt it was about time to suck up to foreign countries and give the Best Picture to another country to start showing they can be inclusive, so why not send some awards to South Korea?We heard a lot of good feedback from friends and family about Parasite, and I would agree that the first half was decent enough, but the latter half I felt I was watching a cheap version of a Bruce Lee action film.I really enjoyed the cinematography, and the set designs were eloquent, but the story failed to impress me and the character development literally fizzled, sort of like when in the 1939 Wizard Of Oz, the wicked witch of the west melted when water was thrown upon her. I cannot honestly say this was a memorable film, certainly not Academy Award Best Picture worthy, and I would not recommend this film as a ""must see"" such as the 2019 One Upon a Time In Hollywood is a must see at least three times.I give Parasite a decent but no higher IMDB rating then 6 out of 10."
332,Primitive,gehad_aldaoudi,22 June 2020,3,"I'm really amazed under which category this film lies. Comedy? It is not funny at all. Tragedy ? I don't know!!!
Four Oscars and Palm d'or !!!! Are you serious.
I can't say that I know better than the people who awarded the film these prizes, I'm sure the problem is me, there is something hidden deep in this movie I couldn't see."
333,A Thrilling Experience,aakashbhatia,5 February 2020,9,"Inspite of movie it was more of a experience and a great one..
So much genres in a single movie and all of them are completely justified with the characters and dialogues..."
334,Great Thriller,jacobdemick,3 February 2020,9,"This film is amazing. Mixes elements of comedy, suspense, and drama in a beautiful manner. I forgot I was reading subtitles after the film, as I was so engaged during the screening. Fantastic plot twists and very interesting and unique character developments. Would give 10th star if it weren't for a couple plot holes."
335,Curiosity,seleneles,4 February 2020,9,"I watched this movie three times.
it was fantastic and masterpiece like everyone said.
there are tons of videos about this movie/subtext on youtube.
I was wondering, while the director was reviewing the comments, was it something similar he thought during the filmmaking process or are people going too deep.
light/dark, high/low, smell, rich/poor all these contrast are just beautiful."
336,Don't Miss It,Karynsiegmann,3 February 2020,9,"This is my second viewing of Parasite and it's just as good as the first time I saw it a few months ago. It's been winning lots of awards and deservedly so.
Ki-taek and his family live in a dingy basement and struggle to make ends meet, but when they see an opportunity to insinuate themselves into the wealthy Park family they devise a plan that, at first, is working like a charm. It's very amusing and with great performances, and you'll be surprised by the conclusion. This Korean film is about family and class division, and no matter how good a plan you have you can't plan for the unexpected. Parasite is the well deserved winner of the Palme d'or at last year's Cannes Film Festival."
337,"Comedy, Thriller, Top Notch Horror",hermesv-41740,7 February 2020,10,"Parasite is a film that leaves one immediately wanting to reevaluate what they just saw. Expertly directed, written, edited, acted, and shot, Parasite is a unique and terrifying movie experience best viewed without any warning"
338,"Parasite, A movie that gets under your skin.",nigellim-21151,24 January 2020,9,"Much like it's creature name sake, Bong Joon-ho' s Parasite is a movie that latches on to you and won't let go. The story of Parasite revolves around a poor family that cons a rich family into hiring them and once the poor family becomes integrated to the rich family, the selfishness of the poor family starts to threaten everything. Multiple times in the film, We are shown scenes of the humiliation, abuse and the depravity of the poor family, the scenes themselves have a sense of morbid joy as they are so well shot and it feels so earned that its hard to look away. The shots are there to tell a story and not used as gratuitous fillers for shock value.Parasite is a movie that challenges us to rethink how we live our lives and just how deep do we affect those around us."
339,"Parasite - Good film, may I say overly hyped?",brankovranjkovic,19 February 2020,7,"Comedy drama.I was attracted to this after seeing the many recent and different awards and commendations.Rich / poor family contrasts. The poor family manipulate the rich family with private highly recommended services. Each member of the poor family use their wit to become an English tutor, Art Therapist, Driver and Housekeeper. The rich family are completely oblivious to their new elite home help, or to what's really going on!The film does a good job of demonstrating social structure, but a little cliché in places. I wanted it to blow my socks off, and in the end I'm bewildered to how this has won so many awards.I'd say this is a well made film but have seen better."
340,"Gisaengchung, the genre-LESS film, a masterpiece",13axfor13,21 November 2019,10,"Parasite is the heart-breaking and mind-shattering story of a poor south Korean family slowly inserting themselves into the life of a much wealthier one, through schemes, intense plotting and brilliantly written twists.
Disguising itself, at first, as a comedy layered with social criticism, the film reveals itself to be a raw dramatic thriller verging on horror of great genius, with moments that will literally take your breath away.
Bong Joon-ho crafts a near-perfect movie, with top-notch careful directing, beautifully flawed and intense writing, heart-wrenching performances and emotionally charged visuals.
But in the end, ""Parasite"", isn't a comedy, it isn't horror, it isn't a thriller and it isn't a drama, it is FILM and that's what is so painfully gorgeous about it.
9,8 / 10"
341,Hnn,sheikhadil-64637,11 January 2021,7,"GOOD movie but itS not amazing
This movie is overrated"
342,Maddeningly bad film,jason-16503,14 February 2020,4,"Should have known when it got the academy award for best picture it would be disappointing. I really enjoyed Bong Joon-ho's Memories of a Murder and Mother. Unfortunately in this movie there was no character development and the characters were just stereotyped cliches. The less fortunate family was just a pack of sociopathic dirt bags and the well off family was laughable with its disinterested father, pretentious and anxious mother, the spoiled son who runs riot pretending to be a Native American as he preys on the house maid with his bow and arrow set, and finally the moody, withdrawn awkward daughter. The only character with any spark is the previous housemaid. The story plods along in predictable fashion with an ending without redemption or closure for any of these pathetic souls. For an academy award winner there were so many silly and unbelievable scenes where things magically disappeared from one scene to the next. Most notably, how the hell did the son in the less fortunate family get that rock back after his misfortune? See the movie and you'll see how ridiculous that is. The Morse code nonsense was tied together poorly and with little purpose. Movie ran out of steam at the end with nothing happening to leave the audience satisfied or even thinking about what just happened."
343,A masterpiece,bsparks-223-709181,6 February 2020,10,"One spoiler question. The father killed Park, went to the alley, ducked into the garage and slipped into the hidden basement. He then uses Morse code to communicate to his son outside the home. Did he not see his son in a pool of blood in front of the basement door? If he saw his son in that pool of blood why did he think he survived?"
344,Best film of 2019,kowas_2,5 February 2020,9,"A great movie. Not a dull moment. What a great script , acting and directing. Probably one of the most original and entertaining film I've seen in many years. A tragedy wrapt up in a comedy genre."
345,'Parasite' is generous in giving you the cerebral food,nagsaptarshi,9 February 2020,9,"Parasite is a deep, complex, layered, multidimensional and heartfelt portrayal of the class struggle and its gruesome ramifications existing in the present day South Korea. It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven'ts, the haven'ts are pitted against each other . It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture. From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax, Director Bong Joon Ho of 'Memories of Murder' and 'The Host' fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human's imperialistic pleasures . As a result, what starts in a mild satirical tone, climaxes in a disturbing manner, so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie, you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle. This is no easy movie, let me remind you. But if you can finish the journey, it can stay with you forever, for the ample food for thought it offers. Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director. Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year, may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well. A must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap DC Comics genre."
346,amazing movie.,amarjaat-88279,30 January 2020,9,This movie shows desires of poor which is all same in any country of world. well acted and well made film.
347,Movie of the year,Hawkeleven,4 February 2020,9,"This film is completely out of the box, a social critic that doesn't choose sides. An absolutely brilliant masterpiece that takes us to a roller coaster of emotions with some kind of new cinematographic genre, that shudder and leave us groundless in a state of deep reflection about the model of society in which we live in. For those looking for an innovative film, with an unusual style, and with a necessary and relevant reflexion, Parasite is the right and the better choice. Impressive work by the director."
348,Class Division and Lack of Empathy - Is It Innate?,AngelaJabla,31 January 2020,9,"Bong Joon Ho's tragicomedy that is a ""comedy without clowns, and tragedy without villains"" (Ho, 2019) is a masterful painting of the division between classes and all the implications and ramifications that come with it. Parasite puts us in the shoes of a low class family and walks us into the life of the elite, making sure to land both class' realities and idiosyncrasies precisely and delicately through the superb acting, meticulous production design and breath-takingly purposeful cinematography. Although the bold and blunt screenplay narrates and exposes our lack of empathy in dealing with people of different classes, refreshingly, the shot selection during a small scene in the second act shows the interaction of a house maid and her boss through the differing perspectives of an adult and a child. In this sequence the directory of photography first shows us the perspective of the adult wherein she is looking over at the boss and her maid and sees a clear visual divide between the two. When the camera shows us the same scene from the perspective of the child, no such barrier is present, and they are on the same side. Bong Joon Ho has exquisitely created a universe that mirrors the realities of his home country today without knowing that the same story resonates through out the globe. Through the chaos that pursues because of the interlacing of these two contrasting families both in the film and in our everyday lives, I believe we need to go back to the mindset of a child wherein we stop seeing people as defined by their social economic status and strive to see each other simply as humans."
349,You aren't make this kind of movie to gain profit or please audiences.,qonitamaryam-74798,20 January 2020,7,"Disturbingly good. Even though I don't like the plot and the ending, there are so many messages in the movie. And this is not american fairy tale, so watched it and I realized this movie was not made to entertain myself."
350,"interesting concept, excellent performance",Jo_Watching,4 February 2020,9,"It's not a horror nor alien movie despite the title and cover. Nevertheless, the storyline kept me on edge the entire time. The concept is so interesting, even though it's common one. The development is very unique, and I was pleasantly surprised. There was never a dull moment!Given the premise of the story, it was interesting to see the prevalence of the family bond in the movie. That aspect of it was very touching.I found the ending good, but a little bland given everything the story went through.Great movie, very psycho!"
351,Overrated,info-13291,23 February 2020,7,"This movie is nice and the idea is interesting, but it's not the best movie of 2019, it's totally overrated."
352,Why we hated this movie,baron-9,4 January 2020,1,"Ridiculous, implausible plot; heavy handed allegory at best. Overdrawn caricatures of rich and poor. I guess some viewers found this funny, but nobody laughed in the theater. The worst was the gratuitous violence near the end, shown with graphic detail."
353,Any Explanation Would Be a Spoiler: Watch It!,gracechrista,28 December 2019,10,"This movie starts off with a seemingly predictable start, a poor kid pretends to be a college student in order to be an English tutor for a rich girl. But what unravels is an extraordinary story of power, greed, insanity, manipulation, and false appearances. It's a slow rise to disconcerting, uncomfortable, and then all of the sudden, it is disturbing and gory and... insane.There is no way to see what's coming next, I promise you that. Now that's a real thriller.Highly recommend. The ending leaves questions unanswered, but many opportunities to philosophize on humanity and class."
354,Parasite,noahmack-32627,18 October 2019,10,I have a feeling I won't see a movie this good or affecting for a long time. Funny and scary and thrilling and sad
355,Parasite (Gisaengchung),appu_hariharann,14 January 2020,10,Stunning screenplay and wonderful acting by the whole team members. Director took the story to the next leave of film. The ending and the start of the story is obviously awesome. Thanks I enjoyed this Movie and loved it . The best Korean Film I have ever watched in this decade.
356,One of the best films ever,sleons,21 October 2019,10,"Parasite is one of those movies were you can sit down and let it surprise you. The script reminds me of Billy Wilder. It switches from comedy to drama because life is like that. The directing is flawless, Acting is compelling. But the most important thing is how it illustrates the sad society we've come to create in the XXI century, with no social mobility. It is fatalistic because bettering yourself nowadays is practically impossible.This film must be seen by anyone who loves movies. It is one that will stand the test of time. Hollywood be worried with your generic formulas, Korea is the new power house and Parasite is the culminations of years of doing things right. American audiences should read subtitles for once. This movie will make you laugh and cry. The story falls into place like this perfect unpredictable puzzle. It's a must watch. A masterpiece."
357,Class Struggle and Deception The Visual Representation.,ShanTeaTime,23 January 2020,9,"Directed by Bong Joon-ho. ""Parasite"" follows the members of a poor household (Kim) scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family (Park) by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.This movie exceeded my expectations. What a way to showcase class struggles and differences between the wealthy and financially lacking in brilliantly done social commentary! This movie feels like it's moving at lightning pace because of how effortlessly it flows. There isn't a dull moment to it, you're either on edge or learning more about it's well-defined characters. Each is distinct and so well performed. I recognized Korean-Canadian actor Woo-sik Choi from ""Train to Busan"" (he's looking fine in this too btw XD) as the brother Ki-Woo. I may be biased because I've grown to really like seeing him, but he was my favorite character in this film. I see him as the main character since he really starts the film with a conversation and ends it with a monologue to his father. Really well done, applause to you sir!I loved seeing the scheming involved in this, with a name like ""Parasite"" I thought this was going to be sci-fi in nature. But it's not at all! It's more of a home invasion film where the rich owners willingly allow these people to come into their lives. The Kim family were some sneaky ba****** let me tell you and I loved it! It's like a better version of Ocean's films (sorry fans of that series), but with less heisting and more actual manual labour. But still a lot of deception, showing class division without making the rich too ""villain-like"". So seeing as the story/screenplay was superb, it's of course coupled with great camerawork/visual representations and an on-point soundtrack to back it up. There's some amazing parallel driven scenes that involve flooding that show that you don't have to treat an audience like they need to be spoon-fed information. Which I appreciate a lot! I'm so glad this film had a U.S. release because not having people over here see it because of subtitles...that would be tragic! I want more foreign films released in theatres over here to be honest!This by far is one of the best films of 2019. It's thrilling, funny, tragic and very very intelligent. Please watch it if you haven't! I'm definitely going to have to check out more from the director/co-writer because he's impressed me highly and clearly is a master at his own craft. I love Asian cinema and foreign films in general, this is exactly why. You miss out on so much greatness if you stick to only ""your language"" while watching films. Don't be one of those people! I'm going to have to watch the movie a few more times to really pick up on everything. Also final side-note, the poster for this film is genius. You'll know what I mean once you've watched it."
358,This is a perfect movie.,humidandaspartamefree,4 December 2019,10,"There are no flaws. It has transcended film itself. It's funny, scary, sad, and gripping from start to finish. As one critic put it, ""It's a magic trick.""I don't care if you ""can't take subtitles,"" or whatever. I can easily recommend this film to anybody. Please watch it and support foreign, arthouse, and indie cinema. But I implore you: go in blind.And I'm hoping for a Best Picture win at the Oscars.Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece."
359,Just average,robglenside,11 April 2020,7,"Clever idea but ended up being farcical.
Excellent acting and original plot however how it ended up into a murder spree is where it was let down."
360,Leave this page if you've never seen this film before,EpimetheusA1,14 November 2019,10,"Don't read another review. Don't watch a trailer. As soon as you get the next opportunity, watch this film. That's all."
361,The Oscars are a joke,jakoboreemders,30 January 2024,6,"Probably one of the most overrated movies in recent years. If I had to summarize this movie to someone that hasn't watched it I would say it's a movie about a poor family that manages to get into some rich family's house and they end up being killed by some random psycho that was hiding in the basement for years. I liked some parts of the movie, especially the first half but it kept getting worse and more random every second. What is the moral of this story? Not having a plan is always better? Life can change in a split second? I don't get the end of the story nor do I know why the guy decided to kill the people he killed. The definition of overrated."
362,Not for me,Sasha_Lauren,19 February 2020,1,"PARASITE (2019)I watched Parasite out of curiousity after it won the Oscar. Well, I watched half of it and fast forwarded through part. The trailer repelled me, so I decided not to watch it before this point. The cinematography was wonderful, but once again, my view is in the minority in terms of public reaction to a popular film. I found the movie sadistic and disturbing. Rather than a provoking statement about class, I saw a dark, sick film laced with contempt, gratuitous violence, caricatures of people, and unlikeable characters with no moral compass. How utterly depressing."
363,Simply Phenomenal!,jared-25331,20 December 2019,10,Parasite is one of the best movies that I've seen in 2019.
364,It's hands down one of my top five,nivethanin,27 November 2019,10,The movie is delivered so artistically while being interesting the whole way through. The hole the characters dig themselves into get deeper exponentially and you're completely on edge the last twenty minutes. Immediately after the movie I was shook to the core. Afterwards I had to do a lot of thinking to fully process what I just watched and understand the social messages. Amazing movie and I know for sure this is not going to get the attention it deserves because it is a Korean film.
365,Best Film of 2019,scottjtepper,24 December 2019,10,"This movie was spectacular.I was hesitant to watch it because of the subtitles, but once the film got rolling the brilliant subtitles allowed the viewer to read them and look up and see the rest of the action for the scene.This will win Best Foreign Film. It should also take home the Oscar for best film of the year. The cast was brilliant, the story was amazing, and the writer-director at the top of his craft.(The trailer shows a scene where one of the actors speaks in English. Perhaps that was done for a fickle American audience, of which I admit to be a member. But except for 3 or 4 lines in English, the rest is in Korean. I can just see the Hollywood studios gearing up for an American version, with Margot Robie and Brad Pitt. But whatever they do, they won't be able to top this magical film and utterly astonishing film making.)"
366,Modern masterpiece!,brkic-ja,26 September 2019,10,"This is , no doubt, modern masterpiece. Talent, imagination, wisdom, combined with actual theme make this one of the best movies in the 21-st century. Go and see it!"
367,SIMPLY THE BEST OF 2019,LynneK100,8 January 2020,10,"Just wanted to register my ""10"" for this movie. I'm late with this review and have nothing to add to the many other reviews previously posted."
368,"A good, relatable, and easy-to-access South Korean film, much like ""City of God"" was for Brazil.",heisenberg12,9 February 2020,8,"Just saw Parasite for the first time with subtitles. For a foreign film from Korea, this is very accessible for all languages and audiences. The actors are all expressive, attractive, and do a really good job acting. The story has lots of universal, contemporary components to it of pop culture.For what it's worth, the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like South Korea's ""City of God"", or something along those lines; what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed, well-written, and pretty gritty.It starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy, which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller, part mystery (without giving away spoilers).I wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating, but unfortunately I just could not. Sorry, but I had to question the ease at which the events unfolded, and that's not to say that it wasn't fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work, but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the ""perfect"" range of storytelling. The same issue also arose in the second, back half of the movie- some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10.However, other than these two (fairly big- big enough to deduct two points) flaws, the script is practically perfect, especially for a foreign film. The writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate, immerse, and challenge your mind, while also keeping it entertaining. They added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made.I was hoping this would win me over for a Best Picture Oscar upset contender, but unfortunately, it just didn't quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility. It could still happen, but after viewing it with an open mind, it looks like it's between Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917.EDIT: Slept on it and decided I would still pick this over 1917 because at least it had a script with some meat."
369,Personal charlatans,Howling_at_the_Moon_Reviews,19 January 2024,6,"So maybe I'm an uncultured swine or maybe some of the effect was lost in translation... but whatever it may be, I'm not sure I understand the hype around this movie.Don't get me wrong, it was good... but it wasn't all that. To be honest I thought it was just above average. I think I may have liked it more if it was a bit more concise. The almost two hour long run time made it feel drawn out especially for nothing super intriguing taking place. There were definitely solid moments throughout, good acting and a general level of engagement, it just didn't super draw me in.I think if I had watched this without being privy to any of the hype I might have liked it more, but I guess I was just slightly disappointed. Regardless, this is for sure a fun and thrilling movie that I would still recommend."
370,Staggeringly original Korean social satire; one of the best of the decade,bastille-852-731547,20 October 2019,10,"I am more than delighted to say that this twisted dark comedy from South Korea more than lives up to the hype. It was the recipient of the Palm D'Or this year at Cannes and has received universally ecstatic reviews. It's an absolute masterpiece, and one of the best films of the past ten years.I won't say too much about the plot to avoid giving anything away, but the film tells the story of a poor family of con artists in South Korea who begin to start being employed by a gullible, extremely wealthy family. The narrative manages to effortlessly and seamlessly combine astounding entertainment with efficacious and impactful social commentary. The film is loaded with substantial messages about class divides not only in South Korean society, but also in the world as a whole. From there, its main raison d'être expands to the analysis of how we can respond to such divides when placed in extreme situations. The results are shocking, startling, hilarious, and utterly brilliant. Such results certainly couldn't be achieved without a truly outstanding cast, but lucky for us, Bong Joon-ho has assembled an astonishing ensemble. Even more impressive is the film's character development. While the film's primary characters are often not the most ethical, they are surprisingly likable and multi-dimensional--especially when heightened by both emotion and tone. You'll certainly remember them long after the credits roll.But what's most unforgettable about ""Parasite"" is that the film manipulates (in the best way possible) its tone in so many unique and engaging ways, that it is able to fully subvert the viewer's expectations of not only how the film will go, but how tone in a film of any kind can be executed under normative conditions. Combining laugh-out-loud, witty comedy, taut suspense, and moments of pitch-black darkness, viewers will be fully immersed in one of the most unpredictable narratives put on film of the past twenty years. While such tonal shifts may sound erratic, they could not have been done more perfectly here--so much so that the film ultimately feels like an unprecedented crescendo in its tone--especially given that the tonal shifts are made more impactful by the film's almost impeccable tightness, not wasting a single frame to keep the viewer fully and utmost engaged.One review cited in the film's trailer calls ""Parasite"" a ""magic trick."" I couldn't agree more, both literally and figuratively. A definite 10/10."
371,Just ok,EasternZZ,3 November 2019,7,"This movie is a vastly overrated film, but still had some cool moments. It just starts off very slow and the first hour is interesting but does drag on after a bit. The story is good, but it just goes on and on without any real purpose. It doesn't really go anywhere until the mid point, which has a really cool twist and you feel like the movie will bring up the topic of debt, but it just sort of stops. Then suddenly the final 20 minutes becomes Friday the 13th.The biggest issue is that you never feel for the main characters. They have no backstory. They are poor, and nothing else. They can't even fold pizza boxes yet still complain when the owner takes off 10% from them. They are kinda unlikable and are pretty much scammers. They cost people their jobs by lying and we are supposed to feel bad for them? They go into people's house and stay there while the people go on trips. You just don't feel for them, and at the end they try to have this big emotional revelation but it completely fails. Why would we feel bad for a bunch of poor scammer who end up being murderers?In the end it had some cool and intense scenes, a hot sex scene, some cool violent scenes, but it is not a masterpiece. The story really goes nowhere and in the end it just ends up exactly where it started. SNOWPIERCER is a masterpiece! Go watch that instead.7/10"
372,WTF is this???,tlgodderz,16 February 2020,1,"I was excited to see Parasite, due to rave reviews, and it winning best picture. I was warned by a theater worker that ""the first half-hour is slow, but then it gets really good"". So I made it through the first half-hour, and kept waiting for the ""really good"" part, only to find out that it was the exact same; more tedium by a family that was not really likable. The violence was not necessary either, and seemed to be a way to make it Oscar worthy. A lot of Oscar nominated movies have violence at the end, and that seems to be a way to get more respect, or something. It was sad, and horrible, in my opinion. I cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie, compared to 1917, Little Women and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, won best picture! Honestly what is going on with those who vote, that vote for this drivel? It was okay, don't get me wrong, but that's all--merely okay. (For the record, I love movies with subtitles, and have seen several amazing ones, but this was not one of them.)"
373,One of the best of the Decade,aakashm-36316,3 December 2019,10,"My favorite foreign language film and definitely my top 20 if not top 10 favorite film of all time
One of the most amazing story telling I have ever seen in a movie"
374,Parasite Review,theredsky,30 October 2019,10,"Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it's not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film's message is a little on the nose but I don't have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film's slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film's story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It's so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it's always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I'm using the word tension a lot but that's what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose."
375,One of the best of 2019,victorjonel,7 September 2019,10,"Excellent writing, acting, direction, drama, suspense and action. A must see this year."
376,Best Film of the year 👏,edsfsousa,23 December 2019,10,"It took me while to be able to sit and review this movie. It has been difficult, almost impossible to put down into words anything about it. I truly lacked the right words and was even afraid not to be true to its core.
Here's a film which leaves no one indifferent. It is certainly metaphorical in every aspect: the water that is both a blessing or a catatrophe depending on which side of the social pyramid one stands; the smell inpregnated in old people's clothes which both disgusts and arouses the rich couple; the large window in their house in comparison to the poor family 's basement window.
The question starts with a simple title:""Parasite"". Who are they? The ones in the basement, at the bottom of the pyramid? The ones in the middle trying to strive, even if they cannot get rid of the smell? The ones on top of that pyramid who pretend to accept others yet lack total RESPECT?
Or aren't WE all parasites somehow and loose perspective so often? Wasn't a camera leading our eyes all the time?
For the first time in my life I had a feeling of real movement while watching a film. Sometimes I was moving left, right, up or down. Sometimes I was watching. Others I was being watched. The window could be either a screen to the outside world, inside the house. I often felt watched in the movie theatre
Was I the parasite?
If this isn't the Best Film of the year, I don't know what it us.👏👏👏"
377,Full Emotion in HQ please!,kylerafa,5 September 2019,10,"I had a very high expectation for ""Parasite"", I believed the hype and I was right! 'Parasite' is what we can call a high level motion Picture in terms of everything. The story itself is funny, intense, terrific and dramatic at the same Time. You go through a lot of emotion, from an enormous laughter to an enormous sadness, to compassion and suspense. It shows not only a society problem but also a suggestion of solution. More, the film is perfectly directed, written and shot, to make you intro it easily. The unanimous Palme d'Or is 100% deserved. See it by yourself, believe the hype, and you'll never want it to finish. Congratulations Bong!"
378,Do not read reviews or the synopsis. Just watch it.,miaharpr,22 January 2020,8,"The best way to view this movie is like the movie Get Out. If you do not know what it's about, it's to your advantage. Enter with a blank mind, and watch it before everyone starts casually throwing the plot and ending around. If you're still reading this, though, I can tell you that it definitely deserves the praise it's been getting. Korean cinema has been overlooked for a while, and Hollywood is finally catching on. Korean cinema has so many great films with unique twists that Parasite gets lost in the sea of them, but compared to all the other Oscar-nominated movies this year, it's a standour-yes, because it's a foreign film, but also because it's not in your face and the same old period, war, biopic, Hollywood-loving-Hollywood movie that seem to get nominated year after year. It's more a subtle, pensive, edgy yet equally humorous and entertaining film that caters to both critics and audiences alike. The cinematography, direction and script are the crowning jewels of this film, but apart from externals, I think this movie deserves more than one view because a lot of themes has surfaced and requires a more in-depth analysis. The characters and their motivations can also be studied. It's a movie you can watch with a bag of popcorn and/or one that requires complete and undivided attention. If you're still reading this, then SPOILER ALERT for you before I write my next line:I can't stop checking every nook and cranny of my house now. If you know, you know."
379,"Suspenseful, but...",Cinematic_Bullshit,27 August 2019,7,"Parasite is a South Korean Movie directed by Joon Ho Bong, who also directed Snowpiercer, Okja, and most brilliantly Mother. Now this movie probably has more twists and turns than any of his other films, which is saying a lot.You never know where the story is headed so there's a lot of suspense throughout the film. At first, you're given a glimpse into the lives of a family living in wretched poverty. Their wifi doesn't work, their basement dwelling gets flooded, and worst of all the local drunk pisses right outside their door. Perhaps this is what makes the family turn into a band of scam artists. That's actually one of the things that bothers me about the film. All of the family members are fully integrated in the criminal activities without any second thoughts about how it will affect the victims. I wanted to see more fleshed out characters who question each other and themselves. I wanted there to be a reason for their turning out the way they did. Poverty isn't enough.Even so, the cataclysmic turn of events is more than enough to keep you engaged. The conniving planning that goes into their schemes keeps you entertained for the first hour. After that a curveball is thrown at them, as well as us, the audience.And again more characters are shown to be treacherous without any explanation as to how they arrived to have that mindset. I'm sorry to point this out again, but it gets irksome. I expected more from the director of the masterpiece, Mother. That is a film that kept me engaged because the characters had motives, even though those motives were somewhat ambiguous. Despite all my criticisms, Parasite is a suspenseful thriller with plenty of content to keep you enthralled for its entirety."
380,A thrilling and hilarious masterpiece.,asherwiegartz,10 October 2019,10,"Man, where do I even begin? Let's start with the technical aspects. It is shot very well, the production design is so good that I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't, the acting is phenomenal (especially from Joon Ho favorite Kang-Ho Song), and the score is the best of the year so far.And now for the story. Just wow. The script tackles so many complicated themes about society and class flawlessly, and it developes all of the characters perfectly. There are about 8 main characters, and they all feel like actual people and not objects for the story. The situation that the characters get in is very interesting and thrilling. This is the best film of the year, and one of the best ever. Just watch it."
381,Stinker,Jeff_34,27 October 2019,No rating,"Looks great, smells bad. That's the overall message and reality of this movie. After so much hype and high reviews, it's amazing to see that the whole thing could have been avoided if : a) dude didn't smell, b) dude didn't say that dude smelled or c) dude didn't hear that dude said he smelled. If that's all it takes to radically change your film then you need to do a rewrite. It's not about class, or social blah blah, or injustice or wealth or yada yada yada, it's about smell and this movie is a stinker. Ca pue!"
382,A credibility issue,mhmt_korkmaz,5 April 2020,6,I could not quite grasp the idea of the movie because of the inconsistent characters. Very intelligent and resourceful Kim family living in the extreme poverty seems the weak point of the script. Unfolding of the events push the credibility of the movie to the level of cartoons watched by the kids. Watchable but not an Oscar movie in my opinion.
383,People going crazy like it's otherworldly!!!,Garhwal-vikas,28 March 2020,5,"Just won Oscars cz concept was new, but this itself doesn't make it a better movie than Joker. Over hyped, Mediocre and people reviewing it in mob mentality. Nothing against Korean movies."
384,Sweet smell of poorness,bartubos,29 November 2019,10,"Parasite is perfect reflection of the era that we live in. I believe it is not coincidence that while we are witnessing demonstration all over the world caused by ecenomic disparities, a movie like Parasite ( also we can add Joker) is publishing. Parasite is brilliant class struggle movie.
Fim starting with a lower class family who are living in a high class family's house as parasite. After the end of the movie I started to think that both family was parasite. Rich family, who are enable to handle daily difficulties, is in need of labour class. And Kim family using their need by cheating them.
Things I like:
#Park family's wannabe, American and the Indian references
#Elevation allegory between houses of the families and the social classes
#Rainfall sequence (Masterpiece directing !!)
#Wrestle of cockroaches to keep the house and the owners of the house does not aware of what is happenning.
#Below the coffe table scene
#Production of sets
#Rising of tension until the birth day party
#Smell of poornessI did Not like:
#Last 5 minutes ( I thing it was not necessery to show us what happened after the birthday party)"
385,Fantastic !,stefstars,27 January 2020,9,"This film is really good and makes you think deeply about the situations it shows. The duality between the protagonist family and the rich Park's is shown in such a wonderful, realistic manner. This type of storytelling has been long missing and I hope more movie makers follow in this trend - in their own original way of course.My one complaint was that the film is slow in some middle parts; some scenes last longer than they should. This could be a cultural difference in film-making, as another South Korean film I watched had these instances as well. Still, it's not enough for me to completely give up on it. It's a proper thriller, American films have tried to pull this off throughout the whole of last decade, but failed (with the exception of ""Get Out."") You laugh, you're sent to the edge of your seat, you get angry, and finally you feel sad. You know a movie is great when it's able to awaken so many emotions and leave you talking about different interpretations of the film long after you've watched it.I'm glad South Korean films are getting the attention they deserve. I've watched other South Korean films in the past and they are excellent storytellers. Congratulations to everyone involved with this film, you all did an amazing job and I'm happy your hard work has been recognized on an international level.Highly recommend this film and if you're avoiding it due to subtitles or the non-sensible bad reviews, you're sorely missing out."
386,The merits of a metaphorical meritocracy,ross-fayers,26 January 2020,10,"I want to say so much about this powerful movie but it is clear from the scores and reviews it is compelling, thought-provoking and subtly absorbing.Suffice to say it's a must watch for anyone who is intreagued by the class decides and struggles of society perfectly framed in a culture of academically hungry people.This beautiful movie crosses many genres and does a fantabulous job of letting you be thoroughly taken into the lives of each character without any judgement to their respective plights.I am left with a silent revilaey that hard work can be a poisoned chalis if it has no real meaning, as much as luck and wealth can leave you unfulfilled if you don't look down with compassion.Or was it all just a metaphor? If so, what for? I, for one, don't care."
387,Masterpiece,junhee-66030,12 November 2019,10,"This film deals with the genre freely. The director's originality, completeness, artistry, and popularity were well harmonized."
388,Its just a masterpiece,ahmadasliahloo,28 January 2020,10,This film will take you throw comedy and sad and madness times...its just a good one that any one can see all of it on the edge of his chair...the movie has a great story with unexpacted events....from the best in this yeare 2019
389,Beautiful,umlaziking,2 January 2020,10,"I really love the way they mixed thriller and comedy, when it got serious it got really serious, when it was funny u would laugh your ass off. Definitely one of the greatest films ever made. I really didn't want it to end, but all good things must come to an end"
390,The strong perfume that hurts the soul,alelucadtb,23 February 2024,7,"I really enjoyed the opening scene of the boy, Ki Woo, taking the wrist of the girl, Da Hye, and taking her pulse to see if she could take the English exam. The scene in which the father and two sons escape from the villa, after locking the old carer and her husband in the basement, is beautiful. Now they are hit by an incessant rain like the worries of young Ki Woo. The father who, understanding the boy's state of mind, tries to relieve him of responsibility but this will not be enough. I didn't appreciate the generalization in representing people rich in money: poor at heart and foolish. I also failed to understand, due to my own lack of understanding, the meaning contained in the stone given as a gift by Ki Woo's friend to Ki Woo's family. The constant reminder of Ki Taek's bad smell triggered his anger due to his social condition and his lack of strength in reserving a different fate for his children.Pressures and unexpected events are always present and the way we react to them characterizes us, what is your plan?"
391,A masterpiece.,tipodaspiaggia,3 November 2019,10,"This movie has it all. Great script, outstanding acting, the drama, the comedy, the thrill, the cinematography and an amazing director. Incredible movie."
392,high expectations,xxxxxdarkmoon,24 February 2021,6,"I was looking forward to Parasite because of the very high rating and the 4 Oscars. Maybe my expectations have been too high for that reason. Anyways, someone has to explain, what on earth is so awesome in it. There is 1 Oscar for the story which is like: a clever poor family deceives a naive rich family.But I can name hundreds of movies that haven't even been nominated in that category before, with a better story.The actors do a good job. It is watchable to kill time. Yes. Some scenes are fun. Yes. Some people claim it is one of the best movies of the decade. Really? For sure, it is NOT one of the best of the decade. It's not a bad movie by any means, just overrated."
393,I still can't believe I finished to watch this 'film',arturargemi,12 February 2020,1,"Worst movie by far I have ever watched.
Plot is absolute crap, predictable and boring.
How did this even got nominated...?
How was this even released!???
I want to believe that all the people that voted 10 was only because it has won an Oscar and they blindly follow whatever gets a prize.
Don't waste a single second of your life watching that."
394,Unconventional and terrific,jackgdemoss,5 February 2020,9,"The Academy Awards are in 5 days and Parasite is nominated for 6 Oscars, including best picture. I thought that the most simple comparison to make is between this and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Both films are entertaining throughout the entire run-time, but really blast off in a bizarre fashion in the final minutes. Parasite is at its best when it uses haunting imagery and compelling character relationships to drive the plot forward. This is one to root for at the awards."
395,Great movie!,mariana-isabel,29 January 2020,9,Great movie! I didn't expect that. I actually just watch it because it was nominated to the oscars but ended really enjoying it. It's definitely going to win best foreign movie
396,Phenomenal,johnmccommon,22 December 2019,10,Everything about this film is simply perfect. Absolutely perfect encapsulation of the stunning creativity and capabilities found within South Korean cinema as of the last couple of decades.
397,Pleasant Surprise and my Movie of the Year!,ethanrfc,27 January 2020,10,This movie surprised me by being near perfect. Struggle to place this movie in a genre as it is diverse and bring in a lot of themes. they nail the humour aswell as some of the deeper moments.
398,A movie that leaves you thinking,Atle_O,27 June 2024,8,"I recently watched ""Parasite"", and I have to say, it was a really good movie, but I still have mixed feelings about it. The film was gripping, and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, but it left me feeling a bit unsettled.First off, the story was amazing. I loved how it started with the poor Kim family trying to make ends meet and slowly infiltrating the wealthy Park family's life. It was clever and often funny to see how they managed to deceive the Parks. The whole idea of the ""parasite"" theme, where the Kims live off the Parks, was really interesting.The acting was top-notch. Every character felt real and relatable. Ki-taek, the father, was especially great, and I felt for him as he tried to provide for his family. The son, Ki-woo, was also fantastic, and his ambition drove much of the plot forward.However, the movie took a dark turn that I didn't see coming. The discovery of the basement and the man living there was shocking. It added a whole new layer of tension and danger. The scene where the old housekeeper returns and tries to reveal the Kims' secret had me on the edge of my seat.The ending was intense and brutal. The birthday party turning into a bloodbath was hard to watch. Seeing Ki-taek snap and kill Mr. Park was unexpected and tragic. It made me question if the Kims were really the ""bad guys"" or just victims of their circumstances.I think what left me with mixed feelings is the bleak message of the movie. It shows the harsh realities of class division and how desperate people can become. While the movie was brilliant, it was also quite depressing. The final scene, where Ki-woo dreams of buying the house to reunite with his father, felt like a punch in the gut because we know it's almost impossible.Overall, ""Parasite"" was a fantastic film with incredible storytelling and performances. It kept me hooked from start to finish, but the dark themes and tragic ending left me feeling conflicted. It's definitely a movie that makes you think and stays with you long after it's over."
399,Parasite is great,a-13188,9 November 2023,8,"Parasite
I think the most brilliant part of this film is the construction of 3 spaces:the house lived by Park's family, the basement lived by Kim Ki-woo's family,and the basement under the house ,which is lived by the original housekeeper's husband.The design of the 3 spaces is a metaphor for the difference in the classes of the 3 family. Every time Kim Ki-woo goes to the house to teach the girl, he has to go on a slope. And when the family run away from the house they have to go down stairs. The rich people living in the house can see the sunshine and grassland, while the family living in the basement can only see passerby's foot, and the man living under the house can never see anything outside that basement. The movie indicates the different living conditions between people in different classes.And the design of the spaces also matches the title of the movie,which is the parasite. Kim Ki-woo's family lives like a parasite. They hide themselves under the table listening the complaints about their smell from the rich. What between the different spaces is the line that can't be crossed.The movie constructed an illusion that the poor living in the rich's house and enjoy the life as the rich does. However, the illusion is broken and all of the poor come back to the real world when the real rich come home. In the real world, those rich people have not only wealth but power. They utilize those who want to climb up and push them when they near the top.It reflects the hidden unfairness in the capitalism. The owner of the power creates a dream for those down on the ground, and encourage them to climb up. But everything end up as foam. It is just like what the movie The Great Gatsby, which talks about a man's dream breaks."
400,to much glory.,wolthuis1978,11 April 2021,6,It was a disappointing. It was not bad. But it was to long. And the story starts strong and then the story changed from poor people to smart people and back to stupid people. The rich family didn.t do anything wrong. In my opinion you don't hated both families. So at the end i was thinking: Where is the rich family? I didn't get any connection with the poor family.
401,nothing can kill them,vshvthcjte,5 October 2023,9,"On one side is the flooded cottage, and on the other side is the birthday party. On one side is the cold and hard gym, and on the other is the luxurious and soft backyard. Money is an iron that irons everything flat. They scrape the internet, live in the basement, and do anything for a job. When you think they are already miserable enough, the movie suddenly turns around: they are not the worst yet, there are even worse ones. If you are rich, there must be someone richer than you; If you are poor, there must be someone even poorer than you. The wealth gap is like countless walls, dividing people into different classes. This wall stands tall even in the wind, sun, and rain, without moving a trace. The Park couple may seem foolish, but they are still getting richer and richer; The Jin Jize family is incredibly intelligent, but they still can't turn around. You think finding a good job with a good salary can lift you out of poverty, but in fact, it's still a thousand miles away. You can wash away the sweat smell from your clothes, but you cannot wash away the smell of the basement that has already merged into your blood. You have climbed ten or twenty floors, and may have just arrived at someone else's basement. They are insects, so their lives are difficult; They are insects, so nothing can kill them."
402,"Have I watched another movie? Good no doubt, but still overrated",akthamhoodaa,17 June 2020,7,"You will not get bored, you will enjoy most of it, but it does not get that level of a masterpiece!"
403,I am confused as to how this movie is labelled as flawless and masterpiece,arindambanerjee11,7 December 2019,1,I was so curious to download this film ever since i read the reviews which are mostly positive. Turns out Parasite is just another predictable story that didnt put me on the edge of the seat as it was promised. I am seriously shocked Cannes chose this film to be its winner for 2019
404,The family that preys together stays together.,jlspenc-84630,24 November 2023,10,"Almost four years ago, South Korea's PARASITE made history by becoming the first movie not in the English language to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. That PARASITE would claim the Foreign Language prize was never in doubt. But winning the big Kahuna?? That was a different kettle of fish altogether. Only two other foreign films, Z and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, found themselves nominated in both categories, winning only for Foreign Language. And yet PARASITE won both!! Released to overwhelmingly favorable reviews in the spring of 2019, it gained far-reaching attention when it captured the Palme D'Or at Cannes. That victory was further capped by positive feedback at subsequent film festivals leading all the way to the year-end awards season.PARASITE was written by Bong Joon-ho, a Korean filmmaker whose resumé consisted of motion pictures that explored the dark side of übercapitalism. Bong's worldwide profile increased tenfold when he made SNOWPIERCER starring a distinguished international cast that included Captain America himself, Chris Evans, along with Tilda Swinton, John Hurt, and Korean leading man Song Kang-ho. A few years afterwards, Bong directed OKJA, a hybrid sci-fi/OLD YELLER story about a genetically enhanced porcine boasting yet another international cast.It was while filming the latter that Bong applied the finishing touches to PARASITE, which he claimed was inspired by at least two sources. The first was an obscure South Korean movie called THE HOUSEMAID about a middle class family whose lives are upended by the presence of a sexually provocative domestic servant. Another influence on PARASITE was the real-life case of the Papin sisters from 1930s France.PARASITE is about two families in present day Seoul who couldn't be more different from each other: the underprivileged Kims and the affluent Parks. The Kim clan live in a basement apartment where they have a wi-fi connection so lousy they sponge off the neighbor by standing in the bathtub to get a decent phone signal. They also endure neighborhood fumigations, stink bugs, and the daily, impossible-to-unsee sight of a wino urinating outside their window. With dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) unemployed, mom Chung-sook and daughter Ki-jung {aka Jessica} earn their keep folding pizza boxes. Their son Ki-woo {aka Kevin} is the most academically promising family member, but the Kims' low income status is destined to make his postsecondary education unfeasible.Kevin's friend Min is due to study abroad and casually suggests that he take over for him as an English language tutor for the adolescent daughter of the Park family. Min will be more than happy to vouch for Kevin, providing he's able to produce the proper credentials. Enter Jessica, who expertly photoshops a forged university certificate for her brother to present to the Park mother, a friendly yet gullible thirtysomething woman who, despite having a live-in housekeeper, finds maintaining the household a handful.The Park home is something I would describe as architectural eye candy, a two-story New Age mansion personally designed by the previous owner. Kevin feels understandably overwhelmed upon entering this domestic Utopia, but knows he must concentrate on the job at hand. His pupil is going through the usual teenage phase of becoming aware of her sexuality, while the preadolescent son obsesses over his belief that a ghost dwells within their house. Kevin suggests to Mrs Park that the boy needs to channel his energetic mind towards art therapy, telling her that he knows a friend of a friend that specializes in this form of psychology. Of course, he's referring to sister Jessica, but conceals the sibling relationship from his new employer.After googling the rudiments about art, Jessica is introduced to Mrs Park, and easily bluffs her way into employment. While being driven home in the family Mercedes Benz, Jessica schemes to oust the chauffeur by blithely removing her panties and strategically placing the undergarments beneath the driver's seat. The Parks, believing that he was using the vehicle for his sexual indiscretions, promptly fire him. Naturally, Jessica recommends a replacement....and here comes dear ol' dad Ki-taek.But usurping housekeeper Moon-gwang is going to be more problematic, however, because her tenure predates the Parks, going all the way back to the original architect owner. By being entrenched in the house for so long, she knows every nook and cranny inside and out better than anyone else. Doing a little bit of research, the Kims discover that her Achilles heel is a peach allergy, which the family of freeloaders shrewdly exploit to induce anaphylaxis....but imply tuberculosis. And guess who's waiting in the wings to replace Typhoid Moon? Yup, you got it!! Mom Chung-sook.So now the Kims ate sitting pretty enjoying someone else's opulent lifestyle....so long as they can sustain the deception. But the Parks' young son innocuously notices something amiss about them without really noticing it. Having an acute sense of smell, he nonchalantly comments how every one of their recent houseguests all seem to have the same odor....and yet they're supposed to be almost unknown to one another! Indeed, Mr Park readily admits that he refuses to ride in the subway because he doesn't want to ride amongst people carrying a lower-class stench on them.Luxury comes a-knocking for the Kims when the Parks pack up for an out-of-town camping trip. Left in charge of the house is the new live-in housekeeper Chung-sook, who secretly brings Ki-taek, Jessica, and Kevin over to temporarily live like royalty before their unwitting hosts return in a couple of days. But at the movie's halfway point, a plot twist occurs {which I will not divulge} that threatens to topple their carefully constructed house of cards.Bong Joon-ho takes pains not to pass judgment on the hard luck, yet opportunistic kinfolk, portraying them as flawed victims of an economic class disparity. To symbolize this inequality, Bong employs some clever visual touches. For example, when we see the Park family on the stairs of their elegantly modernistic suburbia, it's always when they're ascending, not descending. These shots illustrate their upward social mobility....as opposed to the other clan. In delineating the Kims' hardscrabble existence, the director repeatedly shows them in a declining stairway motion, serving as a metaphor for their bottom rung stature. Oddly, PARASITE found an unlikely admirer in North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who couldn't resist using the film to highlight the difference between the two Koreas, an example of the class warfare within his southern neighbor....and of capitalism overall.It's difficult to pin PARASITE down to any specific film genre. In promotional interviews, Bong described his movie as a comedy without clowns and a tragedy without villains. Like a Coen Brothers picture, there's a magnificent wickedness on display in which we find ourselves snickering at situations we'd ordinarily be shocked and repulsed at in the real world. We understand the Kim family's need to seek a better life for themselves yet disapprove of their methods....even as we wind up laughing at some of them.Bong Joon-ho also took home Academy Awards for Director and Screenplay over such distinguished competition from Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, and Sam Mendes. Bong's triumph was certainly a dark horse, but, in retrospect, it really shouldn't have been. Over the past decade, Oscar's directing trophy has been truly international, with the recipients being French, Taiwanese, and especially Mexican. Just the previous year, Alfonso Cuarón won his second statuette in that category....for a movie not in the English language. Hopefully, PARASITE's victory will open up the eyes of mainstream audiences unused to reading subtitles at the bottom of the screen. To paraphrase Bogie, perhaps this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. 🔚"
405,"The ""Parasite"" literally speaking",PianetaMotore,5 September 2024,8,"This film is a great metaphor, I really have a lot to say about this film, starting from the fact that I was very hesitant at the beginning of the film, but going forward this film managed to put me to the test during the development of the story, a very psychological film, it must be said that the plot is very banal but they really developed it well, it obviously has its own flowing plot, and obviously the idea of replacing the family to have a stable job for the whole family is a stroke of genius, obviously it couldn't all go rosy, so the usual plots are there, the ending is what obviously struck me a lot because even though the father wanted to do ""good"" for his family he found himself in the end to be just a ""parasite"" from my totally personal point of view this film is really beautiful recommended."

408,It truly is one of the greatest movies ever made.,anthonyhost,12 February 2020,10,"It sickens me that there are people voting this film down strictly because they feel the Academy was attempting to be ""woke"".Simply put, this is a stunning film that more than deserves every accolade it received and then some.I haven't felt so passionate about a film in quite some time and I truly feel we are witnessing an all time classic being bornBong Joon-ho delivered a masterpiece and we are privileged to see it. Kudos to the Academy for finally breaking the ridiculous void of not honoring any foreign language films for the top prize."
409,Amazing!,owenverhaeghe,9 September 2019,10,"Absolutely breathtaking, easily one of the best movies of this year!"
410,With No Plan Nothing Can Go Wrong,owen-watts,30 October 2021,7,"Parasite landed with a massive splash in 2019, Bong Joon-ho's satirical black comedy is excruciatingly tense and a fantastic confection. Its bracing cynicism makes it drop slightly short of being a clarion call to revolution and it has a few too many endings for me but the unpeeling of this particular onion is tremendously fun. It's easy to see why it did as well as it did."
411,"If you're interested in cinema, you must watch this move.",lutfiyeozturk,28 December 2019,10,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I don't usually give 10 points, but the film impressed me. (It's been a month since I'm still in effect.) The way he describes events and emotions is very interesting. I follow South Korean films as much as possible. I have not seen this kind of narration either in South Korean cinema or in other countries. I would really recommend to anyone interested in cinema and looking for new things. bong joon ho is an excellent director. Every job is getting better and better."
412,Too many genres,mobblethewale,16 April 2021,6,"While many people seem to have enjoyed the wild mix of genres it left me emotionally detached. It starts as a fun plot about getting all members of a skilled yet unemployed...? Poor family working for a rich family without giving away that the poor people belong to the same family. Taking away from the fun is the fact that the poor family are just horrible people, getting rid of the last housekeeper by using her strong allergic reaction. When the rich family is away the housekeeper returns and for some reason the poor family lets her in...? She then discloses that her husband has lived in a secret underground bunker under the house for years after which the tension increases. The last part of the movie is more akin to a horror movie with a bloodie conclusion. All these tonal shifts made it hard for me to view this movie with any emotional attachment. I found myself analysing the movie more than enjoying it.The performances of the actors seem stale and unmotivated with very little gesticulation or similar to express emotion (that might be a cultural barrier but reduced my enjoyment nonetheless). The soundtrack stayed in the background and I don't remember any of it.The elephant in the room is of course the allegories and metaphors that everyone and their grandma seems to have found in this movie. While I agree with quite a lot of the findings considering that I have very little knowledge about south korea, metaphors do not make a movie magically better. While telling a simple story in a complicated way can be an interesting experiment, the movie cannot stand on it alone. I would not have enjoyed or rewatched Memento if its ""gimmick"" of telling a simple story chronologically backwards was the only thing it had to offer. The craftsmanship of Memento was really good from both actors and crew. I missed the good craftsmanship in Parasite, especially from the actors. If you enjoyed finding all the references and it made you think about certain topics and made you feel a certain way then that is great for you, but it is highly subjective and does not make the film ""the masterpiece of a century"". A good movie can have allegories and metaphors as the cherry on top. A mediocre movie does not become a masterpiece by putting in a ton of metaphors for complex topics and hoping to stand on only this one leg.I might have honestly enjoyed a movie that consisted only of an expanded first section. With a more likable poor family, lots of shenanigans to keep undetected and a simple story, this film would have not received 4 Oscars and would not have been hyped like it has been, but it would have been far more enjoyable for me. But thats okay, movies are not just made for me, a lot of people seem to have enjoyed the movie, so its current form definitely has a right to exist."
413,Overrated illogical nonsense,saintpeter-74746,9 January 2020,1,"The west favors the films that look western in its aesthetics and treatment. This film is the example. A commercial, illogical potboiler with not one original character. This film can be compared to a number of Hollywood, European cinema. Everything is stupid and illogical. An entire family cons another entire family into entering their home as servants in various capacity. Top it with a secret bunker in the basement where the previous servant has kept her husband to save him from debtors?! And the owners of the house, a family of 4, has no clue about any of it, despite all these happening right under their noses for years? Sounds stupid and illogical and nonsensical. Sounds like a Hollywood B comedy movie starring Queen Latheefa, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrel and other SNL cast members."
414,A Flawless Masterwork,connorbonelli,10 February 2020,10,"When I heard about Parasite, I heard about the overwhelming praise first. Normally when a movie gets a 99% on RT i end up liking them but I never rave about them (Boyhood and Get Out are prime examples). So i went into Parasite with caution. But i was wrong. It really is THAT good. Not ""good"" its Excellent. Brilliant. Genius. I could go on and on. From the masterful direction to the cinematography and production design, the acting, the script; its all perfect. I don't want to give away anything because if you go in completely blind, you'll walk away with the best film of the year worming through your brain."
415,Perfect Film,matthewjwill,18 November 2019,10,"Incredible film making, acting and story. Really transported me."
416,Fantastic!,T2TLED,9 February 2020,9,"I love this movie! At first, I wasn't sold and then it got into this pace and doesn't slow down. Watch this movie!"
417,A wise Korean insight,bosogea,10 February 2020,10,"This movie crowns all the relevant topics. Such a powerful combination of hatrid, detachment, irony. I dont see any eye opener, but an image from afar. Maybe an eye of the storm opener.
Every reply is well studied and crafted, but the play is powerful and natural due to the high performance - play and sets.
I ve found a very articulate speech, addressing topics like: global warming, Korean Reunification, the ... global enclavisation, the mistification of science, the blindness of the media (Park seemns to be involved with media or visual arts), the running from myths and fears (the ghost from the basement is a very complexe symbol), the dephts of the social construction - with it s double perspective (the rain as a disaster or entertainment).
I ll watch this movie several times, because the building is equally robust and opened to zooming and nuances.
The most, i admired the way it surpassed the cheap propaganda and obvious paths. No, this movie is for me a very complex essay on guilt and limits. Also, the tragedy dissolves in the web / the wave of infinite information."
418,Best Film of the year,nholloschi,21 November 2019,10,I wouldn't say anything bad about this movie because I can't!
419,"No doubt ,one of the best movies of the year",angel-670-456525,5 January 2020,10,"I would describe it as a modern tragicomedy that portrays the drama of social inequality and frustration because of the excessive contrasts between social classes, narrated with black humor, paradoxes and a hint of absurdity.It is a critique of today's society, focused on having, on the immediate gratification, on the excesses for only a few people while we close our eyes to the inequality and poverty of many.Its well deserved, the film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes festival and the critic describes it as ""perfection made film"".P.S. The house is a dream of architecture."
420,"It's different, and odd, which I usually like",designdiva-21029,20 June 2020,6,But I really don't love it as much as all the fuss. It did not deserve to sweep the Oscars. Didn't love it
421,Entertaining,carlo_vives,2 February 2020,9,Never enjoyed and kept my eyes glued to a movie for quite some time. Enjoyably thrilling.
422,A brilliant work of art,sarahhadad-60692,3 September 2023,7,"A movie that not only highlights the difference between the upper economy class and the lower economy class but also wraps around the emotions associated when two classes meet at some point.If you are looking to watch something that's realistic, including drama, story, and emotions, PARASITE is one such movie. No spoilers, but it will leave a lasting impact in recognizing the everyday struggle of the earning member belonging to a lower middle class and how he has to go through tons of emotions hiding the pain from his family members.While also, how such people aspire to become similar to the ones they are working for."
423,one of those films that makes you wonder how the could mess it up,john_9a,6 January 2020,5,"Parasite is itself a parasite of a movie. The start is interesting and the cinematography is excellent throughout the film. It's a lot of fun seeing the street life of this poor family and their living conditions. There are some very unlikely manuplations involving job positions which are all too quickly accomplished and never entirely believable in their successful execution.
What kills this film is the ridiculous second half of the movie and ending.
This is
It makes you wonder if they had a new writer finish the story up. One who just wanted to create an ending and had no concept of how to do it.
Because there was some good acting and great film work, I gave it five stars. But it probably rates less due to bizaare and impossibly stupid parts to the movie."
424,One Parasite you shouldn't avoid,TheCasualReviewer,10 February 2020,8,"SYNOPSIS:
A poor family in South Korea con their way into the home of the wealthy. They soon find themselves in the middle of a dark, unexpected secret.REVIEW:
This film is truly an original masterpiece. From Bong Joon Ho's direction to all of the phenomenal acting. So intricate and precise it left a really special film.
POSITIVES:
As I mentioned, the directing is absolutely superb. Bong Joon Ho really has this immersive directing style that get you to lose yourself within the film. You feel as though your living through what the characters are living through. The acting is Oscar worthy all around. Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park and everyone else had unbelievable chemistry together. The big stand outs to me were definitely Kang-ho and Yeo-jeong. I feel those were the two captains of storytelling for their respective families and it was nothing short of amazing. Whether it was the build up for Kim Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) to what ultimate happens in the end or the absolute unwarranted trust and obliviousness of Park Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). You really get a feel of the difference in class and how a family struggles through poverty in order to make a life for themselves and how the rich use their money to mask their own ignorance.
NEGATIVES:
Its tough for me to come up with any negatives. This is one of those films where I don't see very much wrong at all, however, it's a film I couldn't see myself rewatching more than twice. Not that it's a bad film or too heavy subject matter, it's just not one of those films I gravitate towards for multiple viewings and that's why I don't have it as a perfect 10/10.
CONCLUSION:
This is one of those films I definitely encourage everyone to see at least once. It's so original and so well told that I know this is a film people will go back to and talk about the significance this film has on cinema. It will be taught in classes and will be a timeless film. Superb all around from cinematography to editing. This is a great film to get those opposed to foreign films on the boat. 8.9/10."
425,Master's Flavor,iruri,1 September 2019,10,"High-quality toy tent which does not get wet with rain, and odd contrast of furniture which does not get wet by rain"
426,Bong's Brilliance,view_and_review,22 January 2020,8,"When it comes to foreign films I tend to be a little biased or lenient. They are such a welcome break from traditional Hollywood. When I see a decent foreign film I can't help but want to praise it more because they don't have the multi-billion dollar Hollywood machine behind them. Usually, they have to be more creative, more ingenious, and more resourceful.""Parasite"" is one of very few Korean films I've watched in my life. My foreign film bank consists mostly of Chinese kung-fu movies of which Jackie Chan and Jet Li probably occupy the most space. Korean films are a rarity for me. This suspenseful thriller by Bong Joon-Ho deserves all of the accolades it has received.What I knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them. That is essentially what happened, but you're not holding anyone's attention with that concept alone. Each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable. As the movie developed and we saw the Kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the Park family, we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script.How do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either? Some how ""Parasite"" did that. The Kim family certainly was shady and underhanded, but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead. The Park family was wealthy, yet unlike your average rich movie family, they were not cruel or unbearable people. In fact they were very likeable.Normally, we want our clear-cut good guys and bad guys. We want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose. In the cases where all of our guys are good, we want them all to win. In the cases where all our guys are bad, we want them all to lose. In ""Parasite"" not everyone is distinctly good or bad and there are really no winners."
427,"Both comedy and tragedy, a fierce social satire",slaithier,12 August 2019,10,"This movie, starting as a clever comedy turns into a deep drama in a modern context of social inequities. This movie undelines how social classes remain splitted in today's world (almost as spltited as in Gosford Park). It also questions how the poor working class have to struggle against itself to benefit from the little that can runoff from the rich ones.
Great actor playing and the right pace in the movie makes it a fantastic experience."
428,Masterpiece,mihajloradojevic-02515,20 August 2019,10,"The Parasite is nothing short of masterpiece, proof that asian directors are one of best in the world. It is also well acted. All actors did amazing job. The main theme is social classes. Some scenes, especially the evening when it rained, were devastating. But beside that I found family relationships to be very good represented."
429,Discreet Deception,gt1915,16 February 2020,8,"It's got attention through a Hollywood Event though it is a good film, quite cleverly done. It's quite violent ending takes you by surprise too. It's not worthy of 5 wins of course but not many people know what Korean films have to offer.I'm critical that The Farewell did not win anything then again the power of the Bollywood has neither had any proper reginition."
430,Wow - As an Englishman I've never seen a film like this before,ABThomas,30 November 2020,No rating,"I feel like I've learned something from watching this, I'm not sure what yet, but I loved it!I didn't realise it had comedy in it, but feel like I laughed in all the right places.The acting was superb and the whole concept of the had me fascinated and completely immersed.I'm going to recommend it to friends but not sure how yet. I guess I'll tell them have an open mind and go with the flow, as it's an original and fascinating experience in film making and class culture. Something like that, I'm going to have an enjoyable rethink about what I just watched.In fact I've decided I'm definitely going to watch it again at some point very soon.Bravo 9.5/10"
431,I don't have same idea with others,erva_koseoglu,6 December 2019,6,"Actually until I watched the movie, I heard lots of good critics. It's wonderful, very impressive etc. But I don't agree, the first half of movie was good and also funny, but I can't say the same thing to other half, it wasnt realistic. And I reckon not as good as people standarts"
432,A Darkly Hilarious Dive into Class Struggles,pulpficat,5 May 2024,9,"Set in South Korea, Parasite is like a rollercoaster ride through the twisted maze of class divides, where the rich are living it up in their fancy mansions while the rest of us plebs are left scraping by like crumbs on the floor.The story follows the Kim family, a bunch of scrappy hustlers who manage to wriggle their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family faster than you can say ""social climbing"". It's like watching a game of cat and mouse, except the cats are wearing designer suits and the mice are pulling off the heist of the century.Now, I won't spoil the plot twists for you, but let's just say things take a turn for the... well, let's just say they take a turn. And it's not pretty. But what is pretty is the way Bong Joon-ho manages to blend dark humor with biting social commentary like a master chef whipping up a gourmet meal."
433,Overrated,Retro-R,14 February 2020,6,"Fairly well told story of struggles, hardships and fantasies of south korean lower middle class. Draws some pertinent inferences to cruel class differences capitalism creates and flourishes upon. Attention to details and proximity to reality remains comendable for the first couple of hours and then comes the disastrous climax. The irrational, abrupt, unjustified and plot defying actions of the characters in the dramatic last scene will surely spoil the mood. The climax will also reveal grave weaknesses of the plot which cant help leading to an inevitable low key ending."
434,Most Overrated Foreign Movie Ever. EXPLAINED!,kaidestinyz,27 February 2020,1,"Anyone that thinks this movie is a masterpiece, is incredibly dim-witted. I'll be explaining why this is factual and listing all the silly things done by the main cast.1. Infiltrating your entire family into the rich family's house.They say it's hard to cover up one lie. You know what's harder? Covering up a whole lot of them and that's what the main cast foolishly tried to do on a daily basis constantly. All 4 family members had to fake their identity/qualifications, pretending to not be related to one another when they are, while they literally work together on a daily basis and expect to never slip up. The Kim family was dumb enough to think it was a good idea and foolish enough to think they would not be exposed in time.2. Kevin's best friend problemYour best friend has gave you an opportunity, to earn some cash, to replace him as a private tutor while he goes abroad. He also tells you that he's coming back and will ask the rich's family daughter out who he was tutoring. He has specifically told you that he's interested in her. He also explained that he has personally approached you specifically because he trusted you over his university friends who he finds revolting at the thought slavering over her, because he knows they would have ill intentions and trusted that you wouldn't.What do you think would happen, when your best friend returns. When he comes back to find out he has lost his job, had his girl stolen right under his nose by his ""best friend"", and also finds out the ""best friend"" he confided in, who has broken your utmost trust, had his entire family infiltrated the rich man's family, working under false pretenses.A: Is he going to shake your hand and congratulate you?
B: Expose you and your entire family?Apparently Kevin must have thought the answer must be A.Anyone care to tell me? The answer is B! They would be exposed! Who would have thought about that right!?3. Dining in the rich man's house like you own the placeAlso, with your whole family without a care in the world. Yeah, let us make a mess of this table, get the wine, get the snacks, let's leave a it load of evidences that we had a party here! Oh crap, the rich man family is coming back? Help! I left so much mess here, what do I do now?4. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me thrice, guess I'm going to die.Kevin, why are you such a fool? Your first mistake was not having the foresight with your best friend problem. Second mistake was exposing your entire family and being held hostage by the hostages you were supposed to hold hostage.Third mistake, the most fatal mistake of them all, why did even go back into the basement? You had both of them trapped under. There was no reason to go back. You wanted to redeem yourself? What did you want to do? Kill them? To silence them forever? Well, you failed miserably, caused the death of your sister and almost got yourself killed. I mean, of all things, you brought a rock, you even dropped that rock. C'mon. There's only so much incompetence I can tolerate from one character.I could go on and on. The rock and its supposed ""symbolism"" that doesn't exist. How the ending went down, the absurd morse code. But I'm tired, tired of people over glorifying, thinking this is masterpiece when it isn't, of people explaining the ""hidden meaning"" of symbolism in different scenes that doesn't exist. Like how going up the stars means ascending in social status, how Jessica sits on sofa because she had a higher social status. How the toilet being the highest point in the house is supposedly a symbolism.All in all, I don't actually think the movie was all that bad. But grossly overrated. Definitely not deserving of any Oscars that it has.If you think otherwise, you've been factually proven wrong."
435,What's the real grift,ernestsavesxmas,13 January 2020,9,"This film is always one step ahead of its audience. You are so in tune with the protagonists that by the time they are neck deep into their futile grift, the question of who's right or who's wrong isn't so much as being poised by the master director Bong Joon-ho; it's being slammed over your head with a rock. And when you recover, and the audience claps, the answer still isn't clear.Parasite is deserving of all the massive praise it has received. That I saw this in a packed theater with an adoring, fully rapt crowd truly warmed my heart. It's cinema at its best.As many folks are noting, and I will reiterate: go into this cold! Read as little about it as possible if you can. It will make the experience so much better. This is one I know I will be revisiting often over the years. Enjoy it."
436,The masterpiece of cinema 2019 desperately needed,jg_1977,17 November 2019,10,"There have been a sparse few films in recent years that have melded genres seamlessly, performed at the absolute top of their game in technical craft, offered a scathing sociopolitical commentary, all while telling an airtight and compelling story. Luckily for us, Parasite (Gisaengchung) checks all of these boxes, in a year where we couldn't have needed it more badly. Bong Joon-ho's latest absolutely blows all else out of the water (at least compared to the other 30+ movies I've seen in theaters this year), and in a highly organic and original way. The issue of class and the struggles of the poor climbing the ladder to become wealthy is one that Bong Joon-ho is well-known for using, for instance in 2013's Snowpiercer, yet Parasite never at any point feels like it borrows from any of its predecessors or overlaps with them in any way. This is the film's greatest strength, in my opinion, that it so flawlessly weaves together all of its components, including an interesting and nuanced take on class-structure, originally and in such a way that it feels perfectly natural for the story being told. The same can be said for how Bong traverses from one genre to another. From minute to minute, Parasite will have you laughing uproariously, and then suddenly, have you dead-silent and on the edge of your seat. The comedy is dark and laugh-out-loud, while the suspense will make you want to lean in, if only to try and pull the characters out of the scene, so as to relieve the tension. It should be no surprise, that everything else also falls into place wonderfully, from the poignant performances, to the razor sharp editing, to the stunning cinematography. In a year with both high-budget and indie takes on class-struggle such as Joker and Us, Parasite still manages to stand out, in a class of its own."
437,Great Plot,samirmonir,29 December 2019,10,This movie only describes how good to be a writer and how good to direct such type of movies. Best movie ever created 2019 I think and by far from the closest chaser.
438,ACT LIKE YOU OWN THE PLACE.,Anass-gfx,18 January 2020,9,You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker
439,Masterpiece,salman_shaikh11,9 January 2020,10,So finally I found a movie to write about and guess what I'm short of a word just Go and watch it it's truly a masterpiece
440,The best movie of the year!,dynamitmand,20 January 2020,10,"I find a lot of korean movies slow and unsatisfying but this one wasn't any of these things, neither did it have that annoying american touch, but this movie will suprise you in ways you would never expect!"
441,"Imo, this movie is overated.",VegiStromman,4 December 2019,No rating,"This movie was alright. The acting was good and story was fine, but the pacing and the overall tone of the movie was kinda dull, imo. I wasent that invested in the plot and characters.
There are better movies out there this year, like FordV Ferrari and The lighthouse."
442,Innovative but messy and over-the-top,BlizzyFoxTF,21 June 2019,7,"9 star rating from YMS and a Palm d'Or. What have we here? A dark comedy from a great Korean director going back to his roots? Nois. I'll make sure I pay close attention to this one.As expected, this film is good. However it could have easily been bad, if not for the brilliant cinematography, strong directorial sense, and most of all, thought provoking messages and philosophies that don't hold back at reflecting the brutal reality of class in our society. However, you aren't here to see me laud, you want to know why I don't hold it in as high regards as everyone else.The film feels messy. Although the comedy is often effective, I don't think it fits well enough in this context. The story is innovative, though it does feel familiar in certain parts. The sudden mood changes aren't my cup of tea as well.A lot of the plot points are just too over the top. They can be distracting. They can be too weird, especially regarding the climax/ending (you'll know what I mean). There are little bits of details that never got an answer till the end; or maybe I need more time to think about them, who knows. Lastly, the message is a little bit too obvious and shoehorned in.It is hard to talk about the many aspects of the film without spoilers. At the end of the day I'll still highly recommend this film because, after all it is a good film, and supporting lesser known but highly acclaimed directors is always a good gesture. But I'm still in the process of figuring out why people love it so much. I guess I'm not too appreciative of Korean films considering my 7/10 rating for The Handmaiden, but this is open to change, and if you are willing to engage in well mannered discussion with me, I may learn to like it much more than I do."
443,A social commentary of the highest order,stringheralong,20 January 2020,9,"As many other reviewers have mentioned, Parasite is a masterpiece that deserves a second viewing. There are many subtle lines and actions that piece the film together towards the end.Take for example ""Crossing the line"" - the rich dad keeps bringing it up. He wants his staff to know their place. That family and their staff are like a micro version of society with its different castes.Sure, it was easy, yet deceiving, to infiltrate their household so cunningly, but once they settled in they realized just how different they were from the upper-class folks they were serving. Even the son who tutors the daughter comes to realize that he doesn't fit in despite the daughter's fondness for him, she might even be in love with him (or she's just infatuated).The basement represents the slums in which they reside like cockroaches. The upper-class family lives in an incredible house high up in what I presume is Seoul. When their home gets flooded they lose everything whereas the rich folks are not bothered at all.The party represents a climactic finish where all the confusion, frustration and anger surfaces in a final act of despair. The poor dad knows he will never be equal to the man he chauffeurs around. In fact, the very man he drives around is disgusted by him.This is a great movie that touches on many subjects. I highly recommend it."
444,Disappointing,zyclunt,28 December 2020,6,"It's not a bad movie. But maybe not for me? The story about poor family attaching themself to rich people like ""parasites"" is good. I realy liked first part of the movie but don't understand the dark turn in the second part. Ok so the Kim family lost themself but still they get evil a bit to fast. And the worst of all the party at the end. Why did the father Ki Taek killed Mr. Park? Because he was a bit selfish? Ki Taek just standed there doing nothing when his daughter was dying and his wife was fighting. Mr. Park just wanted keys to the car but for both his son and Ki Taek son. Sorry I know this movie have a lot of allusions and social commentaries but it's presented poorly for me."
445,Not Oscar worthy. Not even close,ryanwinning1,18 March 2020,5,With all the hype around this film and winning the most prestigious award in film with the Oscar for best Picture I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. The story is great with a broke family hustling themselves into working for a rich family in Korea one job at a time was pretty good but the acting was very cartoonish to me. There's a lot of dialogue in this movie and sure it is a well-written script but these actors seem to just be reading the lines a lot of the time and not using their body language to really express the characters as much as I'm accustomed to through American film. I'm very disappointed in this movie and completely shocked that it won best picture. Surely there has to have been a better film made in 2019 than this? I give it 5/10
446,This is true cinema: When everything is just perfect.,poeticanarquica,8 January 2020,10,"If you like cinema, dont miss this movie.At last, ill been waiting so many years for a movie like this: a beautiful, powerful and great history who touch all the film genres, and do it SO well. Parasite is an awesone thriller who break with a lot of spin and turns a masterpiece script.A director in state of grace talks about almost everything: the most inhuman capitalism, how the middle class just dissapear, an amazing tale about the life and death, about the dreams that grow and dies, about you cant runaway for who you really are, and the great hole between the human being.Is better just go and see this movie with no idea about what it goes.
Its the greatest film you see for decades. Believe me.
""Dont do any plans. Life dont go this way"""
447,Magnificent thrilling and unexpected story,borisvoll,27 September 2019,10,The plots are refreshing and thrilling and the movie itself has one of the best paces I recently experienced in a movie.It was best described rollercoast slow ascendts and quik descents. I loved it!
448,"One of the best, if not the best movie of the year",ronaldosievert,16 January 2020,10,"I was looking forward to this movie all year, since i didn't like Roma (the international film front-runner and winner of 2018) as much as others did. This might just be the best foreign language film I have ever seen, with Portrait of a Lady on Fire (my personal favourite movie of the year) being one of the runner-ups.This film was a transcendent cinematic experience for me, as Bong Joon Ho, the director of the movie makes it seem like its a walk in the park to go through the different genres in film. Movies are my favorite form of art and Parasite is just that: The Definition of Art. Lets go #Bonghive 🍯"
449,"Just a perfectly done movie, in every way.",juregreenday,3 November 2019,10,"It's a perfect movie in every way, words can't even decribe this satisfying feeling I got right now after I've seen it. It's an emotional rollercoaster that everybody need to experience. I can't even begin to describe it. Just watch it."
450,Great story great acting great film...end of!,viqarakram,15 January 2020,10,Just watch the damn movie its awesome...hollywood has had its ass kicked...story is so original
451,A devilishly delicious and twisted tale of class dynamics,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,25 October 2019,10,"After hearing so praise much about Bong Joon-ho's latest film when it premiered at the Cannes film festival this year, I went in not trying to know too much about it. And it definitely lived up to the hype.The Kim family struggles to get by as the father, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), is unemployed and are forced to live in run-down basement apartment in an already poor neighbourhood. Conning and manipulation is second nature to the family as it is their only means to ensure they come close to living. And once the opportunity comes in the form of the wealthy Park family needing a new English teacher for their teenage daughter, the Kim's young adult son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) takes the position to help his family get the money they need to escape their impoverished lifestyle. Through a series of planned and highly calculated manipulation and trickery, Ki-woo gets all of his family members employed but at the expense of getting the Park's previous driver and housemaid fired to steal their paid positions. Eventually the Kim's start living off the of the Parks's luxuries as if they entered the gates of heaven and awarded for their scheme.To explain anything more would ruin the rest of the story. The joy of it will be watching the twists unfold as the ideas and themes of Parasite take on a very unique and unexpected look at the class dynamic. The film portrays neither families as the hero or villain of this story. Similar to his English-language sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer, Bong Joon-ho dives deep into a surreal, abstract world to explore the class dynamic between the wealthy and the poor. The difference in this being neither side is worth rooting for nor against. The Kim's take advantage of the Parks's naivety through their con as the most sure-fire way to gain the benefits that are denied to them because of their class status. And so it means they are ignorant to the moral consequences made by their scam until it is too late. Meanwhile, the Parks are so condition to their wealthy and privileged lifestyle they are oblivious to how unfair they treat the lower class while being paranoid and frightened by what doesn't meet their high expectations. The cruel unexpected circumstances of the film's events prove no matter how well planned things go, the poor will still in the end be feeding off the scraps of the rich that blindly ignore them.Don't want to say anything much else about Parasite other then it is worth seeing without not much else about it. Go see it."
452,"Wow, ok but overrated for sure",WeWatchMovies,15 August 2020,No rating,"The film was ok, I think a LOT of people tried to read into it too much and find way too much symbolism. It was ok for a movie to watch when you can't find anything else."
453,It was pretty good.,Daath,1 February 2020,7,"The movie was well written, well acted, well paced, well filmed, well scored. Everything was pretty good. For me, it is a far cry from the best film I've seen. It might not even be in the top 10. Don't get me wrong. It was a very good movie worth watching, and worth watching on the big screen. I don't really get the masterpiece and best film ever comments. It was entertaining and thought provoking. Go see it, but ignore the super reviews as well as the bad reviews."
454,A MASTERFUL CINEMATIC STORY TELLING,LesterCristal,24 January 2020,10,"Exceptionally written, ingeniously directed, and profoundly acted, PARASITE is a masterpiece of its own. This cleverly layered and twisted film is a social commentary about class division that seemingly tied into a perfectly paced and balanced multi genre that is packed with metaphors, implied messages, and symbols. PARASITE is an accomplishment for cinematic storytelling and world cinema that engross, surprise, and shocks."
455,Good but nothing exceptional,vithiet,15 March 2020,7,"It's not a bad movie and it has some great moments. But it's way too over hyped, like much award winning movies these days (insert gif of disapproving old Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino). You can tell it's a movie that wants to deliver a message; the problem is it's not quite clear what the message is."
456,Shocked at the Positive Reception,geebghd,16 May 2020,1,"I went into this movie with very high hopes. So many accolades and Oscars have been thrown at this movie, and while that's not the main requirement for a great movie, it gives off the impression that there has to be SOME redeeming qualities about it. I was excited to see a foreign-language film win Best Picture and was fully prepared to at least enjoy the movie as a social commentary, as many people lauded it as a powerful work of art and ""masterpiece"" (a word that is used WAY too often these days).So basically, I hated it. I got about an hour and a half into the film before my mom and I decided we had enough and couldn't succumb ourselves to watching the rest of this cartoonish sequence of events, despite the fact that I rented it. I could state a plethora of reasons for despising the film but to summarize my thoughts, I felt that the characters were underdeveloped and acted more like caricatures than real people we encounter, the film's aesthetic was not pleasing for the viewer to watch (and I understand that the movie's uneasiness was the point but I was not a fan of the directing style and the strange shots) and I kept thinking some bizarre creature was gonna come out and fully push this film into fantasy/horror genre. I just really did not like anything about it. I usually always finish movies once I'm dedicated to watching something but this was just impossible. I get some of the messages the director was trying to make but it comes off as a complete joke to me that this film won so many awards, including BEST PICTURE. None of the characters were likable. Absolutely none. I'm not sure if I was supposed to hate the rich family for just being rich and slightly conceited and root for the poor family because of their circumstances, but they didn't seem to have any empathy or compassion for even other working-class people like them in the pursuit to get what they wanted which came off as very cold and sad. I love films that make you question who the protagonists and antagonists are and I know not all movies are meant to be uplifting, but these characters were lazily written and we don't get any insight into their inner monologue and feelings. The acting was very mediocre for the most part too and sometimes downright cringe-worthy.I truly don't know what I missed but this was just not my cup of tea (or my mom's) and it felt unnecessarily gruesome and strange rather than masterful and sharp. Instead of awaiting the next moment with excitement and suspense, I found myself cringing at the actors' performances as they weren't believable and was confused at how poorly-written the dialogue was. Not everything that's out there and different hits the mark. This did NOT hit the mark for me."
457,A Masterpiece!,mazrekajalban,10 January 2020,10,I love movies that criticize society and its different classes. This film combines humor and darkness and shows life from different perspectives. Love it!!
458,This movie is going up in the top 250 chart,movie_goer82,1 December 2019,10,"Usually it has been observed that the movies start with high ratings because fans give the highest possible ratings initially but when more people watch them the ratings decline, but this one going up in the chart.This says a lot about this one.Another Korean master piece after Oldboy. Don't miss it, thanks me later."
459,Unbiased art,sepetcenk,22 September 2019,10,"When we were students at the art faculty, our teachers used to say, 'Art or an artist can't be unbiased; you pick a side and tell your story.' I never agreed with this notion. This film proves I was right."
460,Roller coaster of emotions,MovieJunkie5,8 November 2019,10,"Bong's movie is truly a masterpiece for the ages. I was honestly surprised to see such a turn in plot, feelings and actions. My heart was a roller coaster of emotions, laughing and being comfortably sitted and later on the edge of my seat, not laughing now but still rooting for them. The soundtrack was gorgeous, the editing superb, the acting was so genuine and looked effortless. This movie really spiked my interest not only in more of Bong's movies but in korean movies in general!"
461,"Best Film of The Year, if Not The Millennia.",homeslice2311,16 October 2019,10,"This movie without a doubt is the best movie I've seen in years. 2019 has been a slow year for movies, and the 2010s in general - jam packed with superhero movies that are all the same and hundreds of sequels. But this movie is quite the gem.It blends comedy, suspense, family, and a little romance in a beautiful way into a brutal commentary of class and society. I'd love to say more but it's better going into it knowing nothing about it so I'll leave it at that.Go see this movie."
462,"Wonderfully funny, warm, surprising, and beautiful...though not ever astonishing",wmjaeger,3 February 2020,8,"Parasite (2019)With the hype around this movie (""best in ten years"") I had unreasonable expectations. This is a funny, almost silly story with great acting, and with a couple of twists that make it inventive. It's also filmed (photographed) with gorgeous care, lots of gently moving camera, a lot of planning of shots from one to the next to tell the story visually. It's an example of classic great moviemaking.
I thought the acting was especially sharp, like the complex job the leading woman, Yeo-jeong Jo, had of seeming a bit ditzy and selfish and yet not completely lost at sea. And the rest of the cast played types that didn't tumble into stereotypes. The story was smart enough to give them room to be complex, but this isn't a probing complex movie, actually. The content is in the improbable situation and how it leads, almost in a Chaplin-like building of absurdities, to comic tension.
The cameraman, Kyung-pyo Hong, deserves credit, for sure, because he holds the visual structure together in a range of scenes-racing down dingy steps, a downpour in the slums, and graceful geometry in the fabulous house. Director Bong Joon Ho deserves the praise he is getting.
That said, the next thoughts are more a reaction to the praise it's been getting: there are more impressive movies out there in various ways. Even just this year there are movies that have movied me more, or made me laugh more, or were more inventive. (I'm not naming movies.) Maybe since this movie manages all three it's notable, but I'll keep my admiration in place!
Enjoy it!"
463,!! Overrated !!,mahfuzsakib,7 March 2020,6,"I didn't find the movie so interesting. It felt like Mr. Bong was so confused about how to end the movie. The story ran so fast and the household shown was extra ordinary naive, which is also abnormal as a such big businessman.I couldn't break the 2 inch boundary of subtitle too. But this movie could be better."
464,mixed genre,srgymrat33,1 February 2020,8,"This whole film reminded me of ""10 clover field lane "" . It starts out and you think you know where it's going .. 5 turns and 5 wrong conclusions later there you are at the end still wondering if you got it right .It didn't feel forced or silly .. it was powerful .. edge of your seat .. wanting to know what happens next all at the same time causing you to look introspectively within yourself in situations where you are the ""parasite "" or someone is to you .Great acting .. great plot .. great twists . Worth the time . Honestly if I went in with lower expectations it would have been a 9 I was just expecting so much it was hard to surpass that .. but would highly recommend to anyone ."
465,Good but not worth best picture,tomsly-40015,20 May 2022,6,"So, I finally watched Parasite. While the film was not bad and had a different view on social disparity between rich and poor, I still think that this film did not deserve to win best picture at the Oscars.For a best picture type of film I expect more: Top visuals, scenery, camera, sound effects, music, mixing, wardrobe and of course great actors and a really great story. While those actors weren't especially bad, they were not great either. Especially the rich woman acted over the top.Now the story: For me this story was unfolding to easy, too cheap. At the start of the movie, the poor family is depicted as lazy and especially the parents seem to have bad manors. There are those kind of poor people that got hit hard by economy and try to work their way up again. And there are those that just live on the money of others and are not willing to work hard themselves. The family in Parasite falls into the second category. They are not even able to fold pizza card boxes correctly. Nor do they care to present good work results or make a good impression to keep their jobs. Yet this same family is able to get jobs at a rich familiy's home and those rich people (the father is a business man - so not a dumb person) aren't suspicious or realize that they are impostors (the lazy woman from the start now runs the whole household as a maid???). Nor do they ask their rich friends or business partners if they know someone for a driver's or a maid's job. Nope, they just pick the first one that someone unknown recommends that worked for them for just a few hours.The ""worst"" about the story: I could not sympathise with the poor family in the end. It was not like ""Yeah they were treated unfair by society and had to live a poor live in the basement, they deserve better"". In contrary. Especially when they found out that the former maid has hidden her husband in the basement for several years, this parasite family does not connect with those people. They don't treat them better like they were treated before by richer people. They instead want to call the police. And when the former maid finds out that this family are impostors, she also does not connect with them, but tries to blackmail them.So the morale of the story is: Poor people are as bad as rich people and treat their kind with disrespect as well. In the end I had more sympathy with the rich family than with any of those impostors. It wasn't a story about ""from dish washer to millionaire"". It was a story about an unlikable, criminal family that in the end had no redeeming factors at all."
466,Average,elliotjeory,4 August 2020,5,"I didn't think this film was particular good it's not as smart as it thinks it is, the infiltration of the house was unrealistic and the so called twist was predictable. The oscars have no credibility these days."
467,"A superb combination of comedy and tragedy, laugh and cry, joy and sympathy",hiraishinnojutsu,28 June 2019,9,"Comedy and tragedy, the combination of the two is what a Korean filmmaker really good at, and Bong Joon Ho is no exception. Started with comedy, you'll find yourself laughing and going with the flow as the movie suddenly change its color in the middle of it like you have never expected before: the reality of living in poverty in modern world, where one and one's family (and spouses) can automatically be dehumanized by society, with the same level of rats and cockroaches. The opposite goes for the movie itself, as it humanized itself when the two most tragic characters in the movie got snapped and decided that it's enough. One of the most important movie in 2019. Movies like this need to be produced more, and, if possible, outnumber the high-budgeted, massively-hyped, full-CGI, full-action movies."
468,A well deserving oscar win.,Brainscreens,11 February 2020,9,"The way that this film respects its own characters is mind blowing. I really enjoyed watching this movie it's such a brilliant story with brilliant storytelling, it made me laugh cry and be scared in that order.. loved it, definitely gonna watch it again."
469,A masterpiece that showcases an artist truly in control of his impeccable craft,andrewroy-04316,10 November 2019,10,"Parasite is a movie where each element has the precise intended effect. Bong can shift from hilarity to tension in an instant, and showcase surface level plot elements and deeper class themes in one clever shot. If you haven't seen Parasite yet, I implore you to stop reading this and anything else about the movie and just go watch it.The class divide between the two families is at the thematic heart of Parasite. On a surface level everything the Kim family does is to earn money and live more comfortably, while the Park family is as secure as could be and are oblivious to the situation and scheme of the Kims. The twist adds to the complexity of the situation - who's the parasite in the situation and how did the Kim family and housekeeper family get to their respective situations? The ending is a devastating metaphor showing how the family is never really able to get out of the basement or buy that house. It's also an edge of your seat thriller where you're so nervous that the family is going to get caught and then that the other family is going to escape. Even the descent into violence at the end was controlled and each attack made sense. The comedy is an underrated element, as many scenes were very funny, especially the self-portrait artwork discussion which was hysterical. The acting was all excellent, and my two favorite performances were Jessica (the sister), who was so great in showcasing how she acted differently with her family and as a tutor, and Mrs. Park, who portrayed the innocent honesty of the upper class wife perfectly. The cinematography was great and reinforced the class themes, especially in the juxtaposition of how the houses are shot, with the cramped underground Kim house and the spacious green Park house, or how as they go back home in the pouring rain that they keep going down, down, down. So many things to absolutely love about this movie that I could go on about, and nothing feels incomplete or not fully satisfying. Parasite is a genuine masterpiece."
470,The Best Film Of 2019,salinaqvi,15 January 2020,10,"This is not only the best film of 2019 but one of the best in the decades. The film does a wonderful job at crafting the story of the Kim family and their journey with the Parks. The film makes subtle nodes to the class differences between them which doesn't come across as preachy or in your face, which all adds up to a stunning ending. But outside of the class differences, the movie acts a good comedy as well in which you will be smiling at all the various antics of the Kim family does in order to fulfil their plan. Even though this might be a foreign film for non-Korean audiences and you have to read subtitles, you have to look past that because once you do, you wont regret watching this marvel of a film."
471,Parasite is one of the most emotional movies of all times,jmiodrag,18 January 2020,10,"Parasite leaves a strong and lasting effect on viewers. It has surprising and funny story that turns out to be more than a life it self. Actually, it is a life, painted in all colors. In a film industry, Parasite is a Vincent van Gogh.The last movie that evoked so many strong emotions was Precious, in 2009."
472,Best Movie of the Year,Jared_Andrews,8 December 2019,10,"It's difficult to review a movie like this without revealing any spoilers. For real, you definitely want to avoid spoilers on this one. So, I'll just leave you with this.Parasite is an absolute must-watch movie for anyone who loves movies. You owe it to your life to watch the work of a master like Bong Joon-Ho at his very best.See it with a friend. Discuss it afterwards. Then see it again. You'll be glad you did."
473,"At times amusing, overall insufferable, annoying",Matt345,30 September 2019,No rating,"This is one of those movies from a director who has done some interesting movies before, which gets a gigantically good rating and seems the overall most well-produced, but is on the whole boring or insufferable, even while at times amusing or properly ""tragic"". The story has elements of crude metaphor, of course, and shows characters, who at first seemed to behave with magical skill, later behave pointlessly and foolishly to get to a dramatic enough finale."
474,Over-hyped,CrazyArty,14 August 2022,6,A hard up Korean family slyly manipulate themselves into different jobs working for one wealthy family.The story takes an unexpected turn when a visitor arrives.This movie received a lot of good hype and it makes a social commentary. It's very well made but ultimately I did not really like the whole story being told. Not sure I would recommend.
475,It's so metaphorical!,raonadia,3 February 2020,10,"'Parasite - an organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other's expense.'When working-class Woo-sik Choi gets a job tutoring Sao-dam, the daughter of the rich Park family, so begins the slow, progressive attachment of the parasite to its host. This is a domestic comedy/drama with universal undertones of class division that takes a dark turn in a climax that will leave you reeling. There are layers to the story which, without revealing the intricacies of plot, play on class tensions, identity and entrapment.A genre-bending tour de force from South Korea, deftly told by writer-director Bong Joon-Ho and brilliantly inhabited by an award-winning ensemble cast. In a meritocracy who is the parasite and who is the host? A cinematic ode to scratching below the surface of an all too perfect picture only to release a scurry of hidden roaches."
476,Very interesting,jane_austen79807,22 November 2019,7,"The movie was really good! It's worth watching! The struggle of classes and the gap between them is visible in this movie, but all is is dressed with a lot of humor, unexpected events and a storyline and plot that won't let you down or make you feel bored at any moment!"
477,Whers the beef?,wayne_ls,30 March 2020,5,I watched this movie because it won so many awards last year. About 1.5 hours in i got up and started playing on my computer... this movie wasted 2 hours of my life. Its nothing special and i think there are way better movies out there.
478,Deserves every single award of it...,philipposathina,11 February 2020,9,"I already have a good experience of korean movies, and this one has surely been one of my favourite, though to be honest, having a vague idea of what its plot is about when i decided to watch it, i was not that certain of what i could expect since films dealing according to critics and reviews with allegories and social messages always face my instinctive mistrust. Well, these elements are there too, but all slipped and fitted in a very intriguing and solid storyline which though starting as a light, almost comedian style plot, ends up in a bloodshed and furthermore in a very bitter truth, the realworld truth which is too hard to break free from. The film will capture your interest and attention within its first five minutes and this attention will be constantly increasing throughout its duration, a feature rather typical in this kind of stories where a rather insignificant and innocent act leads to a complicated and difficult to deal with situation like in many Cohen brothers films. Taking this in consideration one could say that the twist of this story is not that original after all, however this one, resulting in an escalating complication and a very bitter ending, is really irresistible, and certainly one of the best and most indriguing one you should expect from a movie! P.S Yesterday, global celebration of the Day of Greek language under the motto: ""Do you know you speak Greek?"". So, here's the tip of the day: Did you know that among plenty of others in your own whichever language, the title of this movie too, is actually a 100% greek word?"
479,epical masterpiece,robnico,13 January 2020,9,"This film is art. You need a moment to get the scenario but then you are caught in it. It is breathtaking. It's fun and scary, dark and lovely and just sad. This is perfect in every way. This might need to sink in awhile but it is truely a cinegraphic masterpiece."
480,Brilliant Masterpiece of South Korean Filmmaking,mikayakatnt,13 January 2020,10,"O.M.G... I knew Parasite was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be THAT good.Parasite starts off with a simple premise. Yet, with what Bong Joon-ho accomplishes in this film is worthy of praise and reward. Every twist and turn is unexpected and the execution of the film is perfect.No other word I can use to describe this film: perfect.Every character in this film is ones that viewers can emphasize with. The themes of class conflict (also seen in Boon-ho's Snowpiercer) prevails in this film as well. It's stunning to see these dynamics play out.In parts where you expect to know how the story will turn out, another curveball is thrown that catches the viewer off-guard. Yet nothing destroys the suspense of reality. There were moments in the film where I was biting my nails in suspense.5/5. The timing, pacing, and execution of this film will be studied in future generations of filmmaking. This is by far one of the best films I've seen this year."
481,Brilliant Dark Satire,Pairic,26 January 2020,9,"Parasite: A con-artist family preys on an upper-class couple and their children. That's the bare bones of this film but it is a multi-layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon-ho keeps things going at a brisk canter. A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious, there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help. The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park's home is a joy to observe. First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper, the existing servants just cast aside. Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film. Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror. Another masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho which he (partially) based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family. 9/10."
482,"When life gives lemons , watch Parasite",ahmadyhadi,24 December 2019,10,"A movie that has an entertaining story in the surface and deep meanings as you dive in.The director played it safe by introducing a simple story and gave it a god-tier build up with twisted plot. This is brilliant , you don't have to complicate it in order to get audience attention.I am sure people will diverge and make speculations about the ending , and will never forget this movie as they live."
483,I've never seen a movie more deserving of a 10/10,pmkremyda,18 November 2019,10,"Edit:
After the Oscars craze, i felt compelled to talk about the ""good, but overrated"" comments that I see more and more. Parasite is the perfect example of contemporary art. It's very easily digestible by the masses, as it is an objectively entertaining movie that even Marvel-DC-audiences can enjoy. However this movie is so layered that you can dig for days and still find hidden meanings and metaphors. They're subtle enough though, that a casual viewer can ignore them without loosing any part of the entertainment aspect. Those who seek an important and complex message can find it, and those who seek a 2-hour entertainment can also find it.
Therefore we have the ""good, but overrated"" phenomenon.I've just recently been introduced to the S.Korean film industry.
After a long break from contemporary Hollywood movies, my faith and excitement for cinema has been restored thanks to S.Korean films.
I firstly want to talk generally about the differences between big Hollywood blockbusters and what I've experienced with Korean cinema so far. Just for reference, the Korean movies I've seen so far are basically crime/drama/mystery movies with my top 3 being: 1. Parasite, 2. the Chaser, 3. Memories of murder.
But there are many that I've yet to watch.
What all of those movies have in common is the fact that they are not afraid to be a)real enough to make you relate and feel like you are part of that world, b)funny with respect to the story and the characters, and c) weirdly they felt like they weren't trying too much.
I don't know if it's just me being sick of all the Hollywood's ""trying to be super cool"" act, but I find it refreshing to see a movie not talking itself too seriously, but at the same time handling very serious topics without losing the balance of all the above mentioned characteristics. And I find that very hard to do, it really is a thin line.
I am so excited to have discovered S.Korean cinema, and i wish more people would not be afraid of the non-Hollywood film industry, as I was.So, regarding Parasite.
If you haven't seen the movie yet, and considering watching it, GO WATCH IT!
Don't read anything else. Don't research and ideally don't even watch the trailer.
This movie stuck with me for days after watching it. I wish I could forget what I watched and watch it again with a clean slate. What an experience it was!
My spoiler-free thoughts:
This movie is a master-class in film making and cinematography. All the symbolism and the brilliant shots were so subtle, nothing was thrown in your face. I would almost describe it humble in all its glory. This movie, even if you watch it on mute, has still a story to tell you. Absolutely genius!
All praise to director Bong!
I don't remember the last time I watched a film and didn't check my phone at all during it. I would say, most films, even the best ones, have some filler shots, meaning they have some kind of low energy points. Parasite had me hooked throughout every single minute of it. In other words, you will not get bored. It's so surprisingly entertaining through all its aspects and genres. Dark comedy, mystery, thriller, drama. They blend so good, and seamlessly that it's almost hard to pay attention to them, because the plot just unravels so naturally that it just seems normal to change the whole mood of the movie. Have you any idea how hard it is to do that, how complicated it is? But somehow Bong managed to make it look easy and natural.
When I was a kid, I remember watching the Olympics with my dad. I mostly enjoyed watching the divers. I remember saying to my dad how easy it looked, and how I could probably do it, too (shame on my sweet innocent self, I know). And my dad responded with something that stuck with me: ""Whenever you think that something that somebody is doing looks easy, that is because they are freakishly good at it, and it's actually almost impossible to do by anyone else, and that they have failed and cried and almost gave up probably a million times"".
So, respect to the professionals.
This movie reminded me of that. Something extremely difficult that seems easy, and effortless."
484,Over rated,lozoo20,8 February 2020,6,It's a good movie but really it's over rated. It is also little boring and slow
485,Superb casting and direction,brightest-fairy,29 January 2020,10,"All the actors were convincing, intense performances by all of them. Great directing, art and photography. Some of the most beautiful shots I have seen , specially considering the places they were showing."
486,Over rated,reachwawa,15 October 2019,6,I think this film is overrated. Not sure about all the coincidences happened to the family members are making sense.
487,Convoluted story and plot but good acting,ryan-l-leong,8 March 2021,5,"Parasite received all sorts of rave reviews and the movie is really interesting until the part when they find out the housekeeper's husband is living under the house. Then it gets all whacked. And the son should have been killed by the force of trauma from the scholar stone that was supposed to be for good luck. Too many plot holes, like how could the family move back into that crappy apartment? Wasn't it condemned after all that flooding? Acting was superb but the violence at the boy's picnic was gratuitious and unnecessary. I'm sure some love this movie and want to see it again and again but it was rather dark and depressing. If you have a sick macabre sense of humor this film is for you!"
488,"Engaging, well written and totally captivating",leedan91,12 October 2019,10,"In an age of superhero movies (which I love) comes a story that is so captivating and engaging from early on that I hope it wins an Oscar. Unlike other years where the ""Oscar buzzy"" movies are really drawn out or not that great, this movie is something that everyone can understand and the story flow, twists and turns and commentary on society all are so well done. My wife and I loved this movie. This is definitely a classic."
489,Omg,zibubu,9 February 2020,8,Simply amazing! One of the best movies I watched in 2019. Keeps you on the edge all the way. Great flow. The end was something.
490,It came out in 2019 but I saw it in 2020 and In my own opinion it's the best movie of 2019,joekill162,8 January 2020,10,"Are you kidding me, that this movie wasn't nominated at BAFTA, I guess all the people voting must have been too wealthy to understand this movie."
491,Simply breathtaking,natata555,28 August 2019,10,"Tigers every human emotionits hilarious
its dark
its original
its powerful
its thought provokingtime well spent"
492,Go and watch this movie immediately. This is a masterpiece in film-making.,film_watcher_,21 November 2019,10,"This movie completely surpassed my expectations. This is a stunning piece of cinema. I gave it a chance because of the incredible hype surround it and I wasn't disappointed. It is a very unique experience. The vast spectrum of genre covered in this movie is almost unheard of. It's artistic, irreverent, creative, beautiful, funny, shocking, violent, emotional, inspiring, and compelling. It holds the viewer throughout and it continually build atmosphere. The absolutely insane and unpredictable nature in how things unfold and escalate was so much fun. The fact that the movie could navigate so many genres successfully whilst balancing a consistent tone, maintaining the entertainment, and never becoming boring is a rare achievement. The movie keeps you guessing and and it crawls under your skin exactly like a parasite. The ending is a wonderfully beautiful touch to the story.I particularly loved how the director filmed the locations and used light, sound, and suspense to great effect.I cannot recommend this enough.GO. AND. WATCH. THIS. MOVIE.
10/10"
493,Who is the Real Parasite?,prazz27,21 October 2019,10,"A few moments into the movie, you start realizing that you are in the hands of a master storyteller, as without any exposition you are familiarized with all the characters and thier surroundings.Director Bong Joon Ho has dabbled in murder mysteries, dystopian science fiction, as well as monster movies but this time he takes a very grounded and personal tale which makes you laugh, empathise, grin, and sit at the edge of your seat. By winning the Palme D'or at Cannes and hosting sold out screenings, Parasite had placed Bong Joon Ho in the cadre of the new masters of cinema.The best way to to enjoy the movie is to go cluelessly into it, but what i can say about the plot is that it is flawless in writing and is edited to perfection. Not a single scene meanders and the story is tightly focused on the characters. Which brings me praise Kang-Ho Sok, who plays the father of the Kim family, making us sigh with his disappointment and smile whenever he takes pride in his family.The cinematography in Parasite is a highlight as you get to see the grimy trinkets of Kim family's semi-basement house and polished expanse of park family's uptown villa. The background score selection is appropriate and perfectly blends in, while enhancing the drama.While Parasite might be a suspenseful drama on surface level, it has layers to it in terms of metaphors and messages. It communicates class divide, makes us question the moral compass of the characters and ourselves, and makes you question: who is the real parasite in the movie?Watch the movie and answer the question for yourselves."
494,And again - Overrated,luds-207-273286,16 February 2020,7,"First off the Movie is absolutely ok, but i can't believe it won an oscar! I think it's a good example of todays influence by the media considering this huge hype and overinterpretation. At least the Movie is polarizing but it's far from a masterpiece - it's ok!"
495,Not what i expected!,vinagno,25 October 2019,10,"I was looking forward to watch some kind of survival thriller,that's what i thought from the title but it was completely different but still so convincing.It is a high quality movie and a must watch to understand the level of korean thrillers.After watching this movie only one word came iut of my mouth ""Brilliant"", and understood why it got 10 mins standing ovation at film festival 💥"
496,"Good, but overrated",jwolf-87865,10 April 2020,7,"Although I enjoyed watching the movie, I don't understand why people say this is one of the best movies of the decade. The ending is kinda weird and the middle of the movie is also boring"
497,Average but not as good as ratings says otherwise,JayPunter,2 April 2020,4,I am still trying to figure out why would such meaningless movie get such a high ratings. There are thousands of films better than this but end up getting petty reviews.
498,Awesome and original,izzypito,31 January 2020,10,This is of the best original movies I have seen in a long time. I'm usually not a huge foreign movie fan unless it's a good horror movie but this movie really was that good. Just when you think you have an idea where the movie is heading it completely surprises you.
499,"Kim family vs Park family, and then...",sansay,10 November 2019,10,"At the beginning of this movie we watch the Kim family struggle to survive in our modern and advanced society. Yes, I am being sarcastic. That's all I have left when talking about a society where the hardship of extreme poverty is often contrasted with the excesses of extreme wealth. You might argue that without such problems in our society we wouldn't have so much material to work with and create such wonderful stories as the one depicted in Parasites. Good point, but I will get back to this at the end of my review.The Kim family's struggle to survive is wonderfully illustrated with a perfect balance between funny and sad. We often feel like laughing but then, strangely enough, we also feel like we shouldn't. Something that will quickly become obvious is the connection between the members of the Kim family. They are acting as a tight unit. One might think that's normal since people usually unite against a common enemy, in this case, poverty. But it is also true that this is a family, not just a group of poor people. They care about each other.
Anyway, coming back to the plot, they will interact with the rich Park family and that's all I think I should tell you. How they will do it, what will happen as a consequence is a complex plot which moves like a rise to the top of a mountain, followed by a rapid descent once we passed the peak. You will know immediately when that happens. This moment, obvious to me, was nevertheless striking and masterfully done.As my step-daughter brought to my attention, no one is the main character, all the main characters, all 10 of them, are important, and extremely well acted. Music is used parsimoniously and judiciously as a counterpoint to accelerated sequences which help keep the plot flowing smoothly, and therefore, avoids dead times. The camera work, although sometimes creative, is most often straight to the point. It shows us the situation and wastes no time on useless but beautiful imagery. In other words, every shot counts.This movie, while telling us an interesting story, is also a social statement. And, as I indicated at the beginning of this review, I see this as a great illustration of the consequences of living in a sick society. Sure, it is nothing new, but it brings to mind many questions. The most important to me: do we, as a species who is supposed to be intelligent, continue in the current direction, and continue to make interesting stories, or do we stop, clean up our act, and create only fantasy stories in worlds which are not our own? Note how the Kim family is actually pretty smart and resourceful. And yet, they are poor. Yeah s. it happens, and more often than not, just because of the way our society works, or rather, doesn't."
500,Food for thought delivered with exciting wit,kluseba,12 November 2019,10,"Parasite is the best movie of the year. This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d'Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety-second Academy Awards.This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy, drama, horror, thriller and tragedy. The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea. This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money. Parasite however is less cumbersome, melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit, depth and creativity instead.International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique. The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi-basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet. The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family. The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures. The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control. The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless. Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression, offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions. The movie is so detailed, precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again.I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre. People are craving for a change and are tired of tame, predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels, remakes and sequels. There should be more creative, dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in movie theatres all around the world. If you desire to make a statement in favour of cinema as an artistic expression rather than shallow entertainment, do yourself a favour and enjoy this incredible movie on the big screen. This movie has the potential to become a cult classic and deserves all the praise it gets."
501,Bong Joon-Ho is a genius!,ronakkotian,26 January 2020,10,"Bong Joon-Ho is a director that I'll definitely check out more. I loved Snowpiercer but have left to see the rest of his Korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone. Parasite is nothing short of genius.It's best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what I can say is that Parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible. This film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions. There are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent. Bong Joon-Ho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible.The story of Parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety. Bong Joon-Ho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch. Their motivations and state make them believable to the audience. The events that unfold don't come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing.Aside from the story, this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019. The colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous. There is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic. The editing is fantastic as the film's pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever. The aesthetics on the whole is top notch.I thought Knives Out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of Parasite is extraordinary. Everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles.I really tried to think of flaws but as of now I could not find any. Everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense. Whilst delivering a fun film, there are some great themes and messages this film explores and Bong Joon-Ho sheds light on them visually rather than using exposition which I commend. I love how he respects the audience by not thinking they're dumb.2019 has been one of the best years for film and Parasite is one of the best without a doubt. A lot of people have already seen this movie but if you haven't then go watch it immediately. This is a film you should not miss."
502,Mixed Genre,xhaimike,14 August 2019,10,"If you're looking for a comedy, brutal, dark and drama movie,this is the movie for you. The way they switched from one genre to another is so smooth you'll enjoy every bit of minute watching it. The whole story line is great. 😁"
503,Movie of the year,gcatharino,12 December 2019,10,"The best movie of 2019 has everything: great acting, fabulous screenplay, with funny, tense and plot-twist moments, excelent directing, social critics and acid jokes. A monumental (but easy-to-consume) piece of art that satisfies all audience's tastes. Highly recommended."
504,What was that?,yunusaliarslan,7 May 2021,6,"I was dying to watch this movie with a point like this but' it just doesn't deserve this score. If Inception is 8,6 this movie had a 7,5 with a good perspective. The movie got really meaningless every minute. It ended so ridiculous, ""Oh, I have a plan. Let's make us rich."" Wow, why didn't you do that before? It can be enjoyed very hard but never gets this score."
505,A review from a non Bong Joon-Ho fan.,somf,5 November 2019,10,"I have seen every film he has made other than his first film. I liked them all but felt all of them were overrated other than Memories of Murder. I felt that second film of his was his best until Parasite . I loved every frame of this film. And such a creative plot. This is easily my favorite non American film in years. It is the kind of film that you see with a friend or your partner and want to discuss for hours. It is not a film I really want to discuss too much.The less you know the better.
The purpose of this review is to tell people that have felt the same way about Bong Joon-Ho as I have in the past, that this time all the accolades are deserved. This is a true masterpiece that will be studied for years to come in film classes all over the world."
506,Okish,frankburton-84831,15 February 2021,7,"Had to see what everyone was raving about and that it won best picture. Started ok but became tedious very quickly. No subplots, gave impression of gullible rich. Lacking imagination and poor ending. Yep it was okish"
507,Average,hofmanla,12 July 2020,5,"Don't get all the fuss about this film, it is very average in every possible way. Started interesting but mid-way through it became boring and not compelling."
508,Perfect Film,puneak,11 February 2020,10,"Parasite is a thrilling, funny, surprising and satirical society. This is perfect film."
509,Couldn't be a better movie,ashishtripathy26,10 February 2020,10,"The plot is awesome. Bang jon hoo know how to portait. The background team worked hard to deliver this simple but awesome thriller that changed every cinematic experience I have ever seen. Actors are perfect. Everyone must see, can be seen with family."
510,One of the best script ever!,rem-rarara,24 January 2020,9,"It starts as a high quality comedy movie but things getting change. General look at Parasite, it's true to say that it's kind of horror movie couse' of the main idea. People like Kim family, lives in the real world society and doing ""parasiting"" to other people. This is one of the best movies in 2019 and director's best work after Snowpiercer."
511,Breaking the barriers of subtitles! A historic and fascinating moment to all cinema lovers!,PauloCanuto,11 February 2020,10,"The Academy has made a great decision on to laureate Parasite as Oscars' 2020 Best Original Screenplay, Best Film, Best Directing and Best Picture Awards. Besides having written a new chapter on Cinema's History as the first non-English-language movie to have gained this epic achievement, the Korean film is a timeless masterpiece, whose stylistics, cinematography, editing work, original screenplay and final outcome will be studied for decades and ever!Best Picture to Parasite!
More than well-deserved!"
512,One word. Masterpiece.,antoniusfa,10 February 2020,10,"I went into this movie without knowing anything about it. I had no expectations whatsoever but holy hell does it deliver. It is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's constantly evolving, never boring and so unpredictable. Bong Joon Ho is truly a genius and this is pure art. Everything about this film is perfect, there is not one thing I could name that i would change about it. It deserves all the praise it is getting.
What a film."
513,Mindblowing,filipasfiki,12 February 2020,10,"A true masterpiece. I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film."
514,"Good movie, not an 8.6 IMO",zeratul108,5 March 2021,7,"Good show, fun ride, quite fresh, definitely not overdone. But at a 8.6 rating, the community is saying it's better than The Green Mile, Whiplash, Interstellar, Gladiator and Terminator 2. I personally do not think it's on that level yet. Maybe its score has to do with how all the indian shows are highly rated on here."
515,Amazing piece of art,patrickkeown,29 January 2020,10,"Now THAT's how you make a movie! Kudos to the writer/director, cast and crew for making such a neo-classic work of art! If this movie doesn't win some Oscars, it'll be a crime against humanity!"
516,Too much hype,sajaljain-59093,13 September 2020,7,"This movie is moderately good. I can't believe how it won Oscars. It won even feature in that top 20-30 movies I have seen. There is too much hype around it. I have watched much better movies both Western and Indian which portrays raw class, caste, religious and gender divide."
517,over rated,ronfernandezsf,18 July 2020,3,"Can't believe it won both foreign and america best film.
Some sloppy writing for instance. The Kim family is drunk in the Parrks home..All of a sudden they become sober. They throw glasses and bottles on the floor, then its cleaned up with no one cleaning it. When the two kids are under the ottoman hiding, theres no sign of broken anything. Also, the ex maid has been hiding her husband in the cellar for years (why) and she's been moving the big chest to get down there to care for him all these years. Then when she returns she can't open the secret door so the Kim family can see her. How did she manage all the years before this particular night. The film is very mean spirited and theres nobody to root for except for the poor man who gets killed. Again, sloppy writing. The premise is good but the execution is bad. Oh, and the young kid gets strangled and his head is hit with a large rock. He recovers with nary a scratch. Again, poor writing. Movie makes no sense. On the plus side, the acting is good."
518,Masterpiece,marcelosichonany,25 January 2020,9,"Parasite is, if not the best, definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2019. The film is almost perfect in every aspect possible.Both the cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and the director Bong Joon-ho make an outstanding job with a production design that is off the charts. These three aspects together result in one of the most eye-grabbing movies of the decade. Every shot is, at the same time, beautiful and meaningful, to the point that you could understand the whole movie even if it had no dialogues.The screenplay is also one of the strengths of the film. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won came up with a great idea that is as original as it gets and managed to make it funny, interesting, sarcastic, sad and verisimilar.
The movie shows the difference between classes like ""Roma"" (2018), but has the rhythm and its core similar to ""Get Out!"" (2017).Every character is important and has its moment of protagonism. Due to the complexity and the nuances put in the screenplay, none of the characters is a villain or a hero. The only villains in this story are the unfairness of the capitalistic society and the lack of empathy of wealthy people towards the less resourceful ones.The acting by all the main cast is sublime, but the highlights are Kang-ho Song and Yeo-jeong Jo.
Kang-ho plays Kim Ki-taek, father of the Kim family. He captures the essence of this experienced man that has gone through a lot in his life and has his pride taken from him in the course of the movie, making his character's arc of development the most interesting of the film.
Yeo-jeong plays Yeon-gyo, mother of the Park family. She is the complete opposite of Ki-taek; she's naive and has, and seemingly has always had, an easy life. She's clearly not aware of the things that happen outside her bubble, and that makes her vulnerable to smart people like the Kim family.Last, but definitely not least, the music. It dictates the current state of the film and manipulates the spectator so you get absolutely fixated on the screen. It has hints of suspense, comedy and even horror.Parasite (2019) is one of the finest movies made in the past decade and, most certainly, deserves a watch. It's eye-grabbing in every sense of the word and really fun to watch, but is also very dense and insightful, providing a vision of how things work that's not usually shown in the mainstream content."
519,Splendid,yucel_guler,11 February 2020,9,"This is one of the best movies of the new century. All characters are real and to some extent relatable. While the movie is Korean and leverages Korean culture in many parts, the multicultural, universal takes what made this movie so great.Most importantly, while the movie does make a lot of comments with regards to class differences, it constantly refrains from taking side or lecturing the audience."
520,It's so metaphorical.,bob-the-movie-man,9 February 2020,10,"Everyone said ""Go see Parasite"". Everyone said ""The one rule about Parasite is that you don't talk about Parasite"". So I went to see Parasite. So this is a review about Parasite without talking about Parasite.Kim Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) is a student living with his family in poverty in a sub-basement room, sponging off internet signals and scrounging a living, of sorts, by assembling pizza boxes. Opportunity presents itself when his best friend, the slightly older Min (Seo-joon Park), goes abroad to study. For Min is an English tutor to the up-market Park family's school-age daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Not wanting his fellow 'frat-boys' to move in on future romance - he's lined up Ki-Woo as his replacement.Ki-woo knows he's lucked in when he visits the swanky Park residence and manages to pull the wool over the eyes of Da-hye's not too bright mother Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). But the influence of the family's ""lucky rock"" doesn't stop there. Ki-woo sees an opportunity to get jobs for his sister Kim (So-dam Park), his father Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) and his mother Chung-sook (Hye-jin Jang). And gradually the poor Kim family start to encroach on the rich Park family's lives.You might think that's the story. It's not. Just when you think you know where the film is going - a gentle comic tale with farcical elements - the movie takes a sudden left turn into The Twilight Zone.To say more, if you've not seen the film, would be cruelty beyond measure. It's a truly astonishing script, by writer/director Bong Joon Ho, and my nomination for the Oscar for best original screenplay.It's the details that get to you. This will be a superb film to watch multiple times. There are fabulous details scattered throughout. You know how the more expensive the car the more ""solid"" the clunk is as you shut the door? Listen to the sound effect when the Park front door shuts! Look what happens to the ""one of a kind"" lucky rock!As for one of my favourite films from last year - ""The Farewell"" - you very quickly get to accept and embrace the subtitles. YOU MUST NOT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF. This is a masterpiece of cinema, well-deserving of its multiple Oscar nominations and its Cannes Palme d'Or award. At 132 minutes, it's not a short film, but seldom have two hours flown by faster. It's totally gripping. At times hysterically funny; at times shocking. A class struggle movie of a calibre that Ken Loach would never have imagined!Gripes? I had just one. An action near the end of the movie seems bizarrely out of character and was a ""WTF"" moment that I didn't think the film needed. However, it did set up a wonderful story-telling finale that I will think about for many months.It provoked that seldom found reaction in the cinema when the end-titles ran. A hubbub of chatter and appreciation.It comes with a highly recommended from me.(For the graphical version of this review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.)"
521,The Best Bong Joon Ho Movie So Far?,JerylBlazikerKoh,2 July 2019,10,"A common factor between movie director greats such as Kubrick, Hitchcock, Wes Anderson, Tarantino and more are that they tend to make movies so unique that you cannot just categorize it into just one genre. Bong Joon Ho should be considered to join those greats on the list.If I want to watch a movie with unique storytelling, powerful characters and unexpected twists, this is the director I go to. The only two memories that I have for Bong are Snowpiercer (one of the best sci-fi movies that is more than just a typical sci-fi movie) and Okja (among the best Netflix movies ever), but those are memories I cherish. Move along, you two, because Parasite not only knock those two aforementioned movies off as my best Bong movie, but it may be the best Korean movie I have ever watched.The movie about two families of vastly different wealth gaps brought insight into the faults of our society, especially how we perceive the rich and poor. The poor Kim family needed to make ends meet found an opportunity when the son got a job opportunity to work as an English tutor at the rich Park family's daughter. That became a domino effect as one by one, each Kim family member schemed to work for the Park family through ingenious ways but not all was rosy as it seems.I'll stop here as if I continue on, I will spoil the story. It has twists so shocking my jaw was on the floor multiple times without me realizing.Parasite, just like other Bong movies, crosses over different genres with relative ease. It is a black comedy, a satire and a thriller all in one. To call it a ""Family Tragicomedy"" as what the trailer suggests is a gross understatement for what it is worth. It is not a tragedy. It is not a comedy. It is not even an amazing piece of art. No, it's a revolutionary masterpiece only Bong could make.As for the other elements, the acting is sublime, the cinematography flawless and the dialogue humorous and realistic. I could not pinpoint a single flaw in the movie.In conclusion, I was not surprised at all when Parasite beat Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for the Palme d'Or because after seeing it, I had nothing but praises for the movie. Worth seeing the movie more than once if you have the time to do so. Do not miss this movie at all (and bring along a cup of dry ram-don with optional sirloin steak, if you need to).(Watched the movie at Cathay Cineleisure, 2 July 2019)"
522,A dandelion in a field of roses,jamalwalid,6 January 2020,10,"Wow, just wow. This is one of the most perplexing films I have watched. I don't recall feeling so conflicted after a film since I watched Shutter Island. It's a fresh take on a common idea, and it is told in an unbelievablely beautiful manner. Everything about it was simply brilliant.This film is unlike any film you would watch these days. Rather than having a cliché ""good guy wins, bad guy loses"" theme, it actually makes you wonder: who is the good guy here? Who is the villain? It's been about half an hour since I finished this film and I'm still not sure who I'm meant to root with.""Parasite"" starts as a light-hearted comedy about a poor family tricking a rich family into employing them, and it takes an exciting turn which will leave you on the edge of your seat.Then, a very dark plot twist occurs and the movie suddenly becomes scary and completely different to what you would expect from the first 30 minutes of watching. Just as you think the film would end in the next 10 minutes, it simply goes on and on, taking more and more turns along the way.I watched the film because of some of the reviews I read on here and I am very glad I did. If you haven't watched it then I would HIGHLY recommend it."
523,Just wow,raysatish,17 December 2019,10,One of the best films of the decade... With an impressive cast and a talented and an critically acclaimed directed this movie delivers what it promises.
524,Didn't live up to the hype,ramonster_uk,20 July 2022,6,"Finally got around to watching this movie, even though being a long time Korean movie fan.Unsure how this won an Oscar and has such a high rating. Thought the same with Spirited Away, appears that these movies won Oscars for being different to the Hollywood norm, I think so anyway.It was a fun watch, but not the best of movies like others would suggest. If you have seen many Korean movies before, you will understand that they don't follow the typical Hollywood formula. Watching this is nothing new and there are far better examples of amazing Korean movies.Overall, this is worth a watch for sure, but it isn't the best of any genre IMHO."
525,A movie that will put a lot of questions in front of you!,Diphasan,17 December 2019,10,"Damn you south Korea. This is a top notch movie with high effective result. Storyline, acting, bgm and colour grading were so catchy. After watching this movie only one question is bouncing in my head, Who is the parasite ???"
526,Artsy South Korean Black Comedy Thriller That is Well Done,HarCarmichael,14 February 2020,7,"The scene where the old maid arrives in the video at the door after the doorbell ring was so creepy, and I loved the scene where the family is getting drunk and talking around the table after dinner. The montage with the peach was also masterful, as was the way many scenes were filmed, styled, and handled. I loved how the old maid also got them on cell phone video proving they were all a family and knew each other and then blackmailed them (temporarily).The young Kim family sister is an extremely talented actress, and so is the Parks pampered wife. The other actors were all solid as well. The story is universal and pop cultured so it is relevant and easy to follow for all languages and nationalities.The movie is never uninteresting. Even when it slows down a little in its final half hour or so, it remains intriguing, but this is the only part that I felt that could have been a little bit better. I also had some questions about the incident at the Parks outdoor birthday party regarding why something happened the way it did.The suspense really worked also outside of the mentioned scenes, and the humor was usually landing. The artsy shots and creative decisions all worked within the story. This is a solid movie for 2019 and deserves the Oscars."
527,Bored,jnkfe,10 November 2020,2,I really don't understand how this has such high ratings. I really tried to like it but fell asleep less than halfway through.
528,"Explosive crime and class warfare film, funny and suspenseful",PotassiumMan,15 November 2019,10,"Bong Joon Ho's film about an impoverished family of petty criminals in Korea is full of menacing, mischievous energy and spiked with sharply-drawn characters, with varying shades of moral and ethical decay. It's a rare film you will remember for its sheer personality and exciting twists and turns.It's best to go into this film knowing as little as possible. The family of con artists sees its fortunes take a turn when one day the son by pure chance gains access to the residence of a super wealthy family. The rest should be found out on screen as this film proceeds at a visceral pace and never misses at beat.Performances are strong all around but the father of the family of criminals is brilliantly portrayed by Song Kang-ho, as he embodies all the boldness and fears of a devoted parent who will do anything to provide for his family, however shady and immoral his choices become. He also exemplifies the steadfast defiance of a working class man who refuses to be held down by those more powerful. The rock of the family, he is one of the most likeable protagonists ever.For all the vitality and edginess of this film, there is also a residual melancholy feel to the story. Through all the bitter class struggle and criminal audacity at work here, there remains a lingering shred of human dignity. Grandly recommended."
529,the line between class,jabox-oneandonly,9 December 2019,10,"Bong Joon Ho has an amazing track record. Memories of Murder, Mother, and the Host are fantastic, Okja was awesome and Snowpiercer is good. He's never made a bad movie and with now seeing Parasite twice, I can say he's still going strong. Moreover this might be his best film or at least competes with it (Memories of Murder is still a considerable contender.) The madman went as far as I say, to making the second best movie of the year, only behind the Lighthouse for me. But for everyone else it's their number one and deservedly so. It's just one of those masterpieces everyone and anyone can enjoy, critic and casual viewer alike. The end strikes with blunt surprise and it was nice to gauge the theaters reaction after knowing what was going to happen. Bongs drama and comedy have always meshed so well together without bringing the tension out the scene but with this movie there's that and this amazing tone shift near the midpoint that fits like a puzzle piece; changing the atmosphere, themes, and style in a way that makes 100% sense. It's like many movies in one. This will be talked about as being a classic of the decade for these reasons because of how perfectly it was done.Without spoiling too much, this movie is about class. And not in the obnoxious in-your-face way where the poorer characters can do no wrong and there's an obvious message of ""rich bad, poor sad"" but done in the way by subverting those tropes by making the poor flawed but smart and the rich into gullible people. Themes and messages the movie has are very subtle to being said out loud: that being mostly about exploring the ""line"" between class. Whether that be through extremely great writing or literally through the directing and how it's shot. The whole film is like this where a line in the shot separates the two classes. It's done through lines in the wall, one genius moment of a reflection on a window as it's being looked out of, a fridge, or just as simple as panning down like in the beginning to show they're the lowest of the low in a already low shot. How they view the same things such as rain tells a whole lot too. While the rich enjoy its beauty and smell, the poor despise it because it floods the neighborhood and house in a very tense dramatic scene. Another nice touch is where they're located: the poorer family living at the bottom of the hill get the brute end of the storm while the rich on top are unaffected. But how the poor view and react to other fellow poor people in a twist situation was the point where I knew this movie was genius. Rather than live together, they fight, accomplishing nothing but a good time for the audience.The performances are memorable and witty and not one dimensional, each with a purpose and each one being immensely entertaining in their own way. They all had a time to shine and they did with flying colors. Bongs directing prowess is at an all time high as every frame and movement feels methodically thought out. His gorgeous use of cinematography, seamless editing, and music fits so well and help flesh out the soothing, chaotic, and claustrophobic atmosphere/tone. The set design was also noticeably pleasing as it explores into the themes more. I would give my interpretation on the rock but that would spoil it. I have nothing more to say other than don't read much else about it and go in blind if you can. 10/10"
530,Greatest movie of 2019 EASILY!,nivethanin,28 January 2020,10,I watched this right after I was blown away by joker and didn't think anything that year could get better.
531,"Worth the hype,.....,",srk08914,5 January 2020,10,Saw this movie today after keeping it for shelves for 2 months......a reality in today's world...... acting was top notch. Don't have any words to explain the story. It's simple mind-blowing. Keeps you on hook till the end. One of the best korean movies of the last decade. Hopefully no one will remake it and spoil this classic
532,BALANCED !!,AseelAbhar,26 September 2019,10,"So just lemme give a short review about points that make Parasite the best movie of the year or maybe the century:1- It's a literal Dark Comedy movie although it discusses a non sensitive concept that's actually thrown every where on media2- the economic gab wasn't about the evil rich or the fighting poors and has nothing with specific country u politics/economy3- the balance between reality and fiction that makes ur mind wonder instead of watching the same senario4- ""best plans are those never existed""5-no one of the poor blamed anyone for being like that or even wondered what if6- the end show the human's priority for 'survival'"
533,A masterpiece !,jjhone,9 January 2020,10,"This movie is so great . In my opinion , parasite is one of top 10 movies of the last decade ."
534,One of if not the best of 2019,gokdenizcakr,7 December 2019,7,Absolute cinema perfection.This film is an emotional rollercoaster as a whole. It makes you connect with the characters and makes you hope but after a minute crushes your hopes and then makes you rebuild it..
535,A-must-watch,andjeladespotovic-72530,5 January 2020,10,This movie left me speechless. A true masterpiece. Really creative and innovative.
536,"Good, but not spectacular",swensimon,13 August 2020,7,"It is definitely not a bad movie, but i feel like it is hyped up way too much.
The acting seems a little over the top a lot of the time.
The message is pretty clear, but that does not make the movie stand out.
Nice movie to pass some time, but in my opinion nit the masterpice a lot of people make it out to be.
Maybe I didn't get the message or maybe it's just not that good"
537,Oscar worthy?,doglady-76945,19 April 2020,4,Over hyped nonsense. Too long and I didn't care what happened to characters. Needed to be a short film and im being generous. Although i thought the 3 dogs were better actors.
538,"""Parasite"" Crosses the Line",jon.h.ochiai,3 January 2020,10,"In the midst of Writer and Director Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" wealthy Korean High-Tech CEO Dong-ik Park, played by handsome bold Sun-kyun Lee, describes to his wife Yeon-kyo, played by beautifully capricious Yeo-jeong Jo: His new driver Kim, played by brilliantly overwhelmed Kang-ho Song. Dong-ik says of Kim, ""He never crosses the line."" Consequently, he hasn't had to fire Kim.Paradoxically, Bong's ""Parasite"" purposely 'crosses the line', often amazing us or has us thinking, WTF? That's the inspired genius of Bong and Jin Won Han's screenplay, and Bong's visionary art. There's the curious dynamic. Aside from genuinely charming Woo-sik Choi, who plays Kim's son Ki-woo (also known as Kevin), the Kim and the Park families are essentially unsympathetic. ""It's all about them"". In the bizarre star-crossed love story, Kevin is in love in with the Parks' daughter Da-hye, played by cute innocent Ji-so Jung.Bong and Jin construct their narrative: The poverty plagued Kim's insinuate into the lives of the very rich Park's. Innocuously, Ki-woo's best friend Min, played by bright charismatic Seo-joon Park, asks him to tutor Da-hye Park (Ji-so) while he's away at college. Really, Min asks Ki-woo to look after Da-hye, because Min is in love with her. Yeah, we get how that will go.Min cautions that her Mom Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong) is rather unique. Initially, Yeon-kyo occurs as the unhappy wife and substance abuser. Although, Ki-woo is not the college graduate, his adept sister Ki-jung, played by beautifully acute So-dam Park, brilliantly forges her brother college degree documentation for his job interview with Yeon-kyo. He goes by Kevin.Once acquiring Da-hye's tutor gig, Ki-woo deduces the way to get his sister Ki-jung (So-dam) as the art teacher for Park's troubled son Da-Song, played by untamed Hyun-jun Jung. Ki-jung poses as cousin Jessica. Similarly, the Kim's infiltrate as familial imposters in the Park household. Mom Chung-sook, played by sensible Hye-jin Jang, replaces legacy Housekeeper Moon-gwang, played by solid Jeong-eun Lee.Now, the poverty riddled Kim's vicariously roll in wealth and luxury. At the zenith of their dysfunctional excess, the family parties in complete inebriation in the pristine Park living room, while the Parks are on camping vacation. Naïve Ki-woo even fantasies of one day marrying Da-hye, the love of his very young life.Eventually, Director Bong's narrative spirals into the absurd macabre at warp speed. Honestly, I was the only person laughing out loud in the theater at times. Surprise twists reveal. The absurd hysterical devolves into absurd hysteria. I believe Bong's inventive madness does serve his purpose.In the quiet scene at the Park home, Ki-woo sadly yearns while looking upon all the beautiful rich people at a Birthday party. It's his life that might have been. Rather, it's his life that isn't.Director Bong brazenly explores the very fringes of sociopathy with both artistic style and menacing humor in ""Parasite"". His narrative is ultimately about karma. Absolutely there are consequence for what we do. What we do, can and will come back at us.Yes, ""Parasite"" is darkly hysterical, in your face provocative. It's great to look at with authentic performances. ""Parasite"" might be one of best movies of 2019. I really liked the movie a whole lot.All that being said: ""Parasite"" is not my very favorite movie of 2019. Perhaps, humanity by its very design is dark and light. At least for me, ""Parasite"" fails in its balance of the dark and the light. Again, just saying."
539,This is why the rating scale goes all the way to 10,manuel_medeiros,10 February 2020,10,"Glad I managed to watch Parasite just before the Oscars. A most deserving winner, especially in Original Screenplay and Best Picture categories.Only 10/10 I have given to a film, out of nearly 100 reviews.I am not sure what genre Parasite is. I laughed, stood in the edge of my seat and got emotional all throughout a very compelling 2 hours and 20mins run time.Parasite is a brilliant story about a poor family living in Seoul who tries to entrench themselves as workers in the house of the super wealthy Parks.The contrasts between two lifestyles are beautifully portrayed and yet, unlike most movies, the rich ones are not made out to be jackasses or bad apples. They are merely a family. Certainly different, flawed, but not one you will actively root against.The script is one of the most engaging I have ever seen. Builds at a perfect pace with the story and yet is positively full of suspense.The acting is incredibly convincing, especially the poor family's patriarch Kim Ki-taek, who goes through a very wide range of emotions.I have trouble pinpointing what else makes it so great, but the film flew by for me. I loved every bit of it.Bong Joon-Ho created a masterpiece a very worthy recipient of the first Best Picture academy award for a non-English language film.
It will certain open many others for others to follow him.A must watch.PS: the only movie that Parasite remotely reminded me off is Hirokazu Koreeda's Shoplifters (2018)"
540,Absolute Mind-blowing!,shaiyan-rvp,31 January 2020,10,Just WOW! What a movie I have just witnessed here! Thoroughly gripping right from the beginning to the end. My eyes were glued during the whole 132 minutes. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie wins the Oscars for best picture. No criticisms whatsoever. A Must Watch for everyone out there!!
541,I cant even find a word how amazing this movie! FLAWLESS.,gzd-42293,9 January 2020,10,"I can say that i did not expect that how one movie could affected me like that.
All i can this movie is speechless.
This is so original & real.
This is real life, i am so sad to see that how can poor people and capitalism world can do this to any human being... and also the ''smell''... the best version to explain that how people can feel low, terrible. and how rich people can consider any human being like their slave in modern world. only the system can do this. this film is real because its showing the real world, capitalism and how the poor people can fearless about any other human being in order to get money from them. its scary but its real. this movie shows that you cant trust anyone."
542,Eyes Popped Jaw Dropped 😍,aakashm-36316,8 February 2020,10,"Amazing Director
Amazing cast
Amazing performances
One of the most mind blowing movies of the Decade
Thank you Mr.Bong.Joon.Ho"
543,A MUST WATCH,MandalBros-5,26 December 2019,10,"Finally watched the most talked film of the year, and now I realise why it is the most talked film of the year. Yes I'm talking about Parasite, Directed by Bong Joon Ho. One of the best thrillers I've seen.
Now talking about the story, it was going straight in the first half and was wickedly funny and then suddenly the twist arrives and it'll grip you edge of your seat. After that you can't move from that seat, and at last only sad.
This masterpiece is also technically brilliant. Cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong is damm good for a gripping thriller. And the BGM, it's not like the natural thriller, but the violin and the piano playing is perfect with the situation. And of course the outstanding performance by the ensemble cast.
At last the film speaks about the differences between the higher class and the lower class people and also says ""You know What kind of plan never fails?? No plan at all ""."
544,Great concept with a mediocre ending,Tin_ear,27 September 2020,7,"I think it's fair to point out that this film goes off the rails at the end. I'm not sure why the director thought it needed a big climactic ending. It's a pet peeve of mine when a writer can't think of any other way to close a character arc or plotline then to literally kill off characters who no longer serve a purpose. The finale here feels forced and out of place considering how methodical and slow-burning the first hundred and twenty minutes were. When your themes are so simple and messages so obvious, plot and characters are all you've really got to hang your hat on. And in Parasite it falls flat.And for those snobs who accuse everyone who finds any fault with this movie as some cinematically-illiterate fool who only watches Hollywood blockbusters, I think The Servant (1963) handled this same basic plot with more nuance and emotional impact."
545,Perfection.,garethcrook,14 January 2020,10,"There's quite a bit of hype around this film already, but going in I knew nothing about it. I prefer this, I rarely watch trailers for this very reason (the modern trend of giving too much away in trailers pisses me off). The opening is delightful, a young Korean family out of work and living in poverty, but looking out for one another, keeping positive and striving to help themselves. It's touching, heartwarming and even the slight squalor is beautifully shot. Good fortune finds it's way to them as the children begin tutoring jobs for a wealthy family living in the sort of show home that an episode of Grand Designs would die for. It's not until half an hour in, that this new hope gives way a little. Just a little crack, almost undetectable. What unfolds over the next two hours though is a masterpiece in tense deceit. I'm loathed to give too many details but suffice to say, this is a beautifully dark tale that reveals itself slowly and with such grace, it's nothing short of perfect. I don't think I can recall a film with such intense levels of humour and brazen deception built on the simplest of premises, desperation to survive. The plot, cast, cinematography, every damn facet, flawless. The deft twists of the characters as to who is good and who is bad, as the tension rises to unbelievable yet plausible levels is ridiculously gripping. Even the finale which after such mastery is bound to disappoint, does anything but. I know it's only January, but this surely has to be film of the year."
546,Don't see what all the fuss is about.,DrProfessor,14 July 2020,7,"It's like the world, for the first time, found a box of Korean movies. Having never seen a Korean film they eagerly grabbed one off the top and watched it, and said, 'oh my God, this is the best thing ever'. My advice is to keep digging in that box. There's a lot more that are a lot better in there."
547,Heavy on Style Lacking in Substance,af-27543,18 February 2020,3,"Once again the Academy Awards get it wrong. Awards for film are meaningless and superficial. I've never been a fan of the art house genre. However, I do appreciate the films of David Lynch, and I believe he's the only one that has turned art house into a fine art form. I bet five dollars that the six hour long sequel to this film never sees the light of day at HBO. It's too soon after the disaster that was GoT. Parasite was too slick and packaged for mainstream consumption. Much like the human branding it so desperately tried to spotlight. I could think of a hundred foreign films the Academy passed over for Best Picture for some American made drivel. This film was not one of them. Down with all awards shows!"
548,The movie you thought could never exist,singhabenjaphon,18 December 2019,10,"When you go in unexpected get ready to be hit in the head harder than you can imagine.The movie takes you in for a slow burn which gradually comforts you in its comedic and slice of life plot which then unfolds into an epidemic rollercoaster of twists and turns. I intially thought this would be a gore or hardcore thriller film but it's something ethereal, something you need to let sink in as the film takes jabs at the hardships and reality of both stratas of life. The methodically cinematography and the clever use of sound effects and music makes every scene a work of art.

549,The Best Film I Have Ever Seen.,brucewayne-63130,19 January 2020,10,"I made an Imdb account just so I could write this review. I watch a lot of films, typically one movie everyday and sometimes even two. Out of all the movies I watched, Schindler's List was my all time favourite. That film moved me in ways which no other film has managed to. I am a fan of Bong Joon Ho's work but none of his movies lingered in my mind with exception of "" memories of murder"", that film is a masterpiece. I watched Parasite at a local film festival and boy was I blown away by it. I have watched this movie more than 12 times and every time I watch it I discover something new about it. I just can't stop watching this film! No other film has had such a huge impact on me. Everything is just perfect. The story is unpredictable and extremely layered. Every shot has a visual subtext. The musical score is haunting to say the least. I fear that Bong Joon Ho won't be able to top this film and every movie that he makes after this will be compared to Parasite. I highly recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece."
550,I had to see it twice.,victorjonel,17 December 2019,10,Definitely the best movie of 2019. Everybody who loves cinema must see this film.
551,PERFECT MOVIE! It has EVERYTHING! Don't Miss,catfanatic888,10 February 2020,10,"WOW! I had no idea what to expect from this movie but it was fantastic! The acting was top-notch, there were laughs, dramatic moments, scary ones too. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Don't Miss this brilliant movie!"

553,One of the best films of the year as well as Bong Joon Ho's career,louis_southwood,15 December 2019,10,"Parasite is written and directed by Bong Joon Ho (Memories Of murder, The Host, Snowpiercer) and tells the story of a poor family living In Korea who take particular interest in a wealthy family as they slowly integrate themselves into there lives. Thats the basic/general premise for Parasite, and don't look anything else up about this movie beacuse make no mistake, this is a movie best experienced by knowing as little as possible, it also just so happens to be one of, if not the best movie of the entire year aswell as Bong Joon Ho's entire career.Where to even begin with this one. Well let's start with the director himself. Ive always been a huge fan of Bong Joon Ho's. The Host is one of my favourite monster movies and Snowpiercer is a fun ride aswell, however it's Memories of Murder that really impressed me. A perfectly constructed crime thriller which put Ho on the map. Ho is a extremely ambitious and confident filmmaker who seems to be always trying something new with every movie he makes. One thing that always strikes me and many other fans of Bong's work is the overall tone of his films. Just like his previous work parasite is really difficult to place into just one genre. At times it extremely funny and playful, the next minute it will be an nail biting thriller with a hint of horror. Bongs writing style is something that I have always enjoyed but here in particular It works extremely well.My favourite aspect of this movie (Besides basically everything) is the characters and the writing. Parasite is a movie that is examing social classes and showing the divide for what it truly is, in the film we see perspectives from both poor and rich families. With that in mind you may have some preconception of how these families are going to be shown based on what you have seen in the past. However you would be wrong. Ho manages to show both families with the same amount of respect as each other. His not trying to make the rich looks evil but at the same time not trying to make the poor look like saints. He is just showing human beings and the effect that these social class divides take on us. One thing that Bong Joon Ho said in the Q&A after the screening that struck me was: ""There are no Villains in this film"" and it's true. This all lends itself to a truly unique experience where you understand every characters motivations and understand the actions that they take, and in turn practically don't necessarily know who you want to come out on top.Just go support this movie if you get the chance. Especially if you are a fan of film as an art form. Beacuse this truly is a masterful put together movie that from the second it starts to the end had me transfixed."
554,"""With no plan, nothing can go wrong""",Bored_Dragon,5 May 2020,7,"Metascore 96, IMDb Top Rated Movies #26, higher than "" The Green Mile"", ""Léon"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""C'era una volta il West"", ""Django Unchained"", ""The Shining"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", even ""2001: A Space Odyssey""... Oscars for Best Picture (first one ever for a film that's not in English), directing and screenplay and Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival... close to five hundred nominations and awards... I honestly don't get it.The movie really is good, but in any of the categories I could possibly classify it, it wouldn't be at the top. I came across comments that the film successfully combines almost all genres. I don't know what they were watching, but I was watching a morbid drama about a ""con-artist"" family and social stratification. Comedy, thriller, horror, ... were we watching the same movie. And if someone asked me to recommend him a good South Korean movie, I don't think, in a few months, this one would even come to my mind at all. In a similar fashion, I would probably recommend ""Oldeuboi,"" which, although I saw it a couple of years ago and gave it a seven, I remember as I saw it yesterday. And regardless of the genre, the first association with a South Korean film would definitely be ""A Moment to Remember.""I'm not saying it's not worth a look. Those who love well-shot sickness and modern South Korean cinema should definitely not miss it, but I certainly won't re-watch it.And finally, one question - does the movie's title refer to the Kim family or the Park family ?! I think this is an interesting topic to think about. I guess the author meant poor fraudsters, but from my perspective, their employers are essentially bigger parasites.7,5/10"
555,"A must see,",q-manjsturd,14 November 2019,10,"Compelling characters, gripping plot, Parasite everything a movie should be. Stupefyingly unpredictable, it's remarkably refreshing and leaves you drop jawed at its conclusion."
556,parasite,auuwws,3 December 2020,6,"The film's story was excellent and the characters the director tried to convey were great, but he didn't deserve a Best Picture award. Acting in the movie was good especially for the rich wife. The angle and camera were excellent and the director in the film was excellent. In conclusion the film was accepted"
557,Exaggerated,rajs_luvwimp,29 March 2020,5,All I wish to say is do not go by the rating or the hype. It is an average movie but with a slightly better storyline. There are way too many movies which are much much better.
558,See the potential Oscar-winner before it's spoiled for you!,gavinp9,1 February 2020,8,"'Parasite' is a South Korean family drama/black comedy, with some great acting and a unique premise. It doesn't take long to establish the characters, but does well to give us time to get to know them. It's essentially the tale of two families: the Kim's - Dad Ki-taek (Kang Ho), Mum (Hyae Jin), Son Ki-woo (Woo Shik) & Daughter Ki-jung (So Dam), and the Park's - Dad Dong-ik (Sun Kyun), Mum Yeon-kyo (Yeo Jeong), Son Da-song (Jung) & Daughter Da-hye (Ziso).The Kim's are poor, living in the 'slums', when Ki-woo gets a job tutoring Da-hye at the Park's nice house on the other side of Seoul. Even though there's symmetry in the parents/son/daughter, this isn't an 'Us' scenario, but rather an exploration of class, social status and unconscious biases. There's no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" - just a semi-realistic depiction of one family seeing the greener grass on the other side and taking an unconventional approach to get there.All of the actors are great, with a nice mix of fun and humour, with seriousness and desperation. The twist at the end of the second act is both unexpected and still poses a lot of questions - there's a few different ways it could've played out. Not quite a one-location film, but the house does serve as an extra character. Good score and cinematography. The ending is a fitting mix of bittersweet, devastating and hopeful."
559,Story of two Korean families,tomfeller,3 February 2020,9,"This is the first time I can remember that a Korean-language film has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, and it is also nominated for Academy Awards in the International Feature (former Foreign Language Film), Original Screenplay, Production Design, Editing, and Director (Bong Joon Ho) categories as well. It is already the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival. This movie was funnier than I was expecting. Set in Seoul, it shows a poor family, the Kims, ingratiating themselves with a rich one, the Parks. The members of the rich family are actually quite decent, although somewhat condescending and gullible, and the Kims are likable rogues. The Kims, consisting of a father, mother, son, and daughter, live in a semi-basement apartment that looks out on an alley where drunks urinate. The father and mother are unemployed, the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) has failed the entrance exam for the South Korean university system, and the daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dan) has failed to get into an art school. They fold pizza boxes for cash. When a friend (Park Seo Joon) tells Ki-woo that the Park teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so) needs a tutor, Ki-woo applies for and, with the help of documents forged by his sister, gets the job. Then when he learns that the Park toddler son needs an art therapist for a recent traumatic event, Ki-woo recommends his sister, without disclosing that that she is his sister. (The traumatic event that the boy suffered becomes important later.) With the help of Google, she bluffs her way into obtaining the position. Then Ki-jung figures out how to get the Park family chauffeur fired, and the Kim father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) gets the job. Using the cook/housekeeper's (Lee Jung Eun) peach allergy, they manage to get her fired as well, and the Kim mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) takes her place. By halfway through the film, the Parks are employing all four of the Kims without knowing that they are members of the same family. Complications ensue, of course, and there is a plot twist that I did not seek coming. As a social satire, this film is excellent, although the violent ending seemed incongruent with the rest of the film."
560,It's more than a Typical Korean Film,amrithsys,6 February 2020,10,You Can't Call Yourself a Movie Maniac If you didn't Watch this Film.
561,it's my own perspectives,shansonpeter-79924,30 January 2020,8,"'parasite' A parasite is a living organism that receives nutrients from the host body And parasites are not good for the host body
What if two parasite organisms come together in one host body? .this is what the 'Bong joon Ho' put forward to us .the main theme of film is Characteristics of Human Beings Changing their circumstances.Reality is that after all, more than half the species on Earth are parasites, and most organisms are host to a number of them.kim ki- taek is a poor man who lives in a basement home with 4 of his family members.the only family income is Proceeds from pizza cover making.One evening at dinner, a friend of Kim Ki-woo's (Kim Ki-woo is Ki Taek's son) came to visit ki-woo and he gifted his grandfather's a collection stone to them and forward a job opportunity to ki-woo. Ki-woo makes a fake certificate and looks forward to that job, and then he starts teaching Mr. and Mrs. Park's daughter in their home permanently. da hye fall in love with ki -wooMrs. Park's son da - song
He is a child of disobedience but he is highly talented of drawing
Ki-woo sees this as an opportunity and recommends his own sister as a drawing teacher and an art therapist, But really, she's not one of these and she also enters the house.Kim ki - taek tells his family ""rich people are realy gullible""
The two Kims plan to dismantle Mr. Park's driver and appoint their father as the driver, and then the entire Kim family together plan to disband the hose keeper. Kim's wife comes to the house of the park's housekeeper, and they all continue to work
It is here that the name of the film becomes a make senseKim's family life goes well in that house. One day Mr. Park's family goes on a camping trip because tomorrow is his son's birthday
Kim's family gathers at Mr. Park's house that night, unbeknownst to Park
Suddenly, the former house keeper gets there and changes the story of the entire course That night, everyone in the house changes their lives.
If I say anything more about this movie, it will affect the enjoyment of the film.Bong joon ho was able to make the screenplay of the film nuancly crafted Everything that comes out of this movie is interconnected, even a stone.Kang ho song's performance as ki - taek is subtle.The acting of kang's physically and mentally embracing the mannerism of the character is commendable.
The storyline, which goes on as usual, is as terrifying as it gets near the end of the story.The director was able to intensify all the situations in the film, and he is worthy of applause.
(example :Ki - taek tells to Mrs. park that your house keeper has TB.
the housekeeper takes a coughing when Ki - taek and Mrs.park steps up the stairs then the camera focus toward Mrs.park's face The director edits those scenes into Slowmotion)"
562,Korean way to spice up a story at its best!,TheCriticalHaunt,14 February 2020,10,"As a fan of Korean movies it's impossible for me to avoid various titles which leave me the feeling of adaptations from western and europe movies.So far not disappointed

563,"Disturbingly funny, unexpected and original",sdrtn,2 February 2020,8,"This is a class distinction based story full of allegory and plot twists. It's a drama, comedy, mystery all at once. Makes you question about right and wrong in a unique way.
But it has also a darker side that makes you feel overwhelmed apart from the story itself. It may be the coloring of the movie."
564,Good but not THAT good!,craig-fraser87,6 June 2020,6,"The acting is great, humour is funny and the first half of the movie is so enjoyable, it has everything you want and is one of those that has you asking questions as to how the family can keep this going. Sadly ending of the movie just takes this film downhill way too fast and the final 20 minutes or so is just odd and disjointed. What happens to the wife, daughter and son who lived in the house? what about Min? Surely he returned from his travels? It's like the writer had the perfect idea all the way up to the killing off of characters and then didn't know how to tie up the loose ends. They instead just play on the political message about the gaps in wealth and class which is why I think this film appealed to the Oscar's."
565,Exhausting but fantastic,kchandlerbast,8 February 2020,9,"It's weird watching foreign films because you aren't always sure if you're watching a good performance or not. But in this film you don't have to question. The movie starts out intriguing for the first hour or so then becomes exhaustingly exhilarating. The entire last hour is a nonstop thrill ride, for lack of a better cliche."
566,"Interesting in Parts, Mostly Boring.",betchaareoffendedeasily,8 September 2020,No rating,"This movie is bolstered in it's ratings by ""piling on"", but in this sense, it is a piling on of unearned praise. This is a mixed, it will examine the good qualities, some of the misnomers of other reviewers, and the bad qualities of this film. In case anyone wonders, this is not my first Bong Joon Ho movie, I watched ""Host"", which Parasite is so far ahead of ""Host"", which was a 5 at best when all things were considered. ""Host"" is also a movie that gets far better reviews than it deserves, it totally squanders its good ideas, and ""Parasite"" does the same.""Parasite"" is expertly made technically, outside of it's script(which is sophomoric at best), ""Parasite"" is not a classic, it isn't groundbreaking, and it is not that good; although it is a mildly interesting film by the end, it cannot make up for the fact that it is boring because it is completely predictable if you have watched even a few films. ""Parasite"" may refine what Ho did with ""Host"" and irons out the kinks, it isn't enough to rise about a 7 when all things are considered. I have watched enough Korean films to know they are quite different from their Western counterparts, and even other countries such as Japan or Hong Kong. Parasite is relatively dull and predictable for the most part, but it does have a cohesive vision and tone that, for your average movie goer, it will set it apart from almost anything they have seen, and for those unfamiliar with Korean cinema, this will seem a lot more unique then it is. I've seen movies similar to this from Korea, it really isn't too unique. If you want to see a truly unique Korean film, see ""Save the Green Planet"", which is about 14yrs.I too watched ""Parasite because of the hype, but I could not stop watching the clock up until the last 20 minutes, other than a minor twist or two, it was totally predictable, and it was highly irritating to see the movie dragged out to over 2hrs, it just wouldn't end Had it been 100 minutes at best, this might actually be a 7.5-8, even with it's unoriginal storyline. Despite it's overly long run-time and predictable script, the direction is Ho is vastly better here than ""Host"", the cinematography is well-done, beautiful music, good acting(those saying the acting is bad are wrong, this is an absurdist film, the acting is supposed to be, well absurd), the lighting and sound are great, so from a technical standpoint, it is great, but it is a very predictable script with too much padding, the script is also largely devoid of any real character development(there is only a little bit towards the end), and is filled with cliches, which some are probably confusing for clever. Better characters would have driven home some of its main points better, and this script is in desperate need of some trimming.In terms of the story, unlike others, I do not feel it is far-fetched what the family did, per say; people get conned every single day While others saw the poor family as being portrayed as dumb and lazy, I saw it differently. What struck me was the father wasn't lazy or stupid, he is the typical hapless and bumbling father that is so prevalent in Asian films. Mostly he appears to have lost the ability to care and was aimless, without purpose; and doesn't actually care about his family, which makes him hard to like. He has a small progression in this film, it just isn't enough. The son, on the other hand, was shown as cunning and selfish from the beginning(in the incident with the pizza company), and once the family saw that he had been able to complete this ruse as a tutor, and they got on board with his plan. The father and son of the poor family, are by the far the most fleshed out characters, but that isn't saying much. While I didn't like the stereotypes on either end either the rich or the poor families, and it does seem to make the rich people the bad guys, which is pretty absurd given they were swindled, and far worse by the end of it. The film, despite other's claims, had nothing meaningful to say about class struggles, it is simply the same rote nonsense that is in most films these days.Unlike some, based on the slow-burn of the events of the film, the violence here felt natural, and it didn't feel out of character for these people; it felt like a natural progression of the script and the feelings these characters have bottled inside. This sudden outburst of violence at the end after a long slow buildup, doesn't feel as shocking as maybe it was supposed to be.Do not come to this looking for traditional comedy, you don't find it here. It is more what would be called a black comedy, or even a dramedy it just isn't in the traditional sense This film is extraordinarily absurdist, however, it doesn't get absurd enough. The closest Western relative I can think of, which really does have extreme and cartoonish violence, is ""War of the Roses"", a movie that does extraordinarily well in making you feel how horrible divorce can be using absurdities. ""Parasite"" also contains elements of a typical thriller, yes, there are some bad things and some violent things in it, but that does not equal a horror movie. It maintains a consistent tone throughout,with the exception of a portion in the middle and the end where it tonally takes some left turns, and these elements actually feel a bit out of place, in a bad way. Fir the most part, it blends the genres together and maintains a consistent tone.On the whole, I don't like this film, even though it is such a leap from ""Host"", which was mostly awful, and wildly tonally all over the place with downright awful pacing. ""Parasite"", on the other hand, sets it's tone from the beginning and it really never changes much, the pace also stays the same, and that is quite a feat. As previously noted, the predictability of the events in the film, minus a few blips here and there, makes it an extremely dull ride unless you've watched very few movies. I cannot fault it's technical achievements, but it is painstakingly dull in others because of its predictability. I would rather go watch ""Save the Green Planet'' again instead of this film, it is a much better example of absurd Korean cinema. With only a few events to really keep you interested it is impossible for me to recommend this, even the twists feel more like cheap tricks than an organic part of the story. Granted, I am not against gimmicks, but this movie is not deserving of 4 or whatever Oscars that it got, nor an 8.6. I can only guess it won due to Tarantino's incessant lobbying, he loves this guy's films.Don't buy into the hype, watch it if you want to, but don't accept the hype, scrutinize it endlessly, it deserves it."
567,Interesting but certainly not spectacular!,qui_j,1 March 2020,6,"The movie covers a variety of genres and social issues that rapidly developing countries like South Korea are facing, a sudden but unequal distribution of wealth, and inequality between classes. It revolves around a family of Grifters who feel they must take back power and exact revenge on a wealthy class family. The problem with the film is that it tends to drag out and become boring after a while. The viewer loses interest. The story could have been told in a much shorter time. It does tend to show what lengths people will go to if they feel they are the underdog, and what they are capable of doing to extract revenge."
568,Its very Normal movie,ankush-gulaty87,28 February 2020,5,"Not sure why its hyped so much. Its a normal movie, not so great and definately not oscar worthy. Jojo rabbit is far better. I watched it after all the hype and i was dissapointed."

571,Parasite as a social landscape,japan_fan-433-116835,13 February 2020,10,"Parasite is a one of the kind film, analyzing the relationships of power between people, social and economic classes and also between genres. The director was capable of camouflage such critics even within the urban landscape, creating political and social spaces that differ and are affected differently. There are subtle nuances of how climatic circumstances are seen and felt by the different spectrums of social classes. Parasite's narrative and visual language achieves a tremendous sensation on the spectator, a sensation of social verticality."
572,A film worth rewatching.,sanda_moroianu,8 February 2020,10,"I tend to evaluate a film by the time it takes us to discuss about it afterwards. Parasite just premiered in Romania and we just returned home, but it's two hours since we keep on discussing it- enough to rate it with 10 stars- which happens very seldom, I must admit. I am no connoisseur of Korean films, so I am not entitled to place it here or there, nevertheless I am totally in control of my personal film hierarchy and Parasite sits high and mighty somewhere on top. Is it a satire, a comedy, a thriller, a social fresco, a mystery? It's all of them and then some. It kept me on the edge of my seat for all of its two hours. It was informative of Korean lifestyle. It was entertaining. It was gruesome. It was comic. It was satirical. It was endearing. It was never boring. Not only the actors are great in it, but the house itself deserves a place of its own in the cast. As a traveler around the world I sometimes found myself in neighbourhoods just like the ones in this film- both the favela style ones and the super rich ones. Every time I was wondering how such poverty and such richness can coexist peacefully. Not anymore, although for my peace of mind I hope not so dramatically. Parasite made me laugh, made me cringe, made me question life, gave me food for thought. What more should I expect from a film? To watch it again, clearly!"
573,Such an achievement,esther-646-830070,5 February 2020,10,This was a wonderful film and I enjoyed absolutely everything about it. It's thought provoking and the story of a poor family wanting a better life isn't new but this particular concept is just amazing. I will be thinking about these people for a very long time. I can't wait to watch it all again. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it
574,Masterclass film,catchuanbu,3 February 2020,8,"Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. But this is truly a story that has many layers and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, With pitch perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year.It is a very strong contrast after 40 minutes of the story, to see the father of the family on the same scene , trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is fine.So when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morality of the rich and poor families. Are the rich really evil do ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them?Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show nobody is right or wrong. It's just the situations that makes us react the way we do."

I think this is GOOD film making, but not the best movie of the year.I've heard others call this a movie about class structure. Yes, but in true Hollywood fashion, the rich people are generous and trusting if a little naive. The poor people are conniving criminals willing to take what is not theirs, or cheat and lie if given the opportunity.Watch to be entertained. That's it. Don't read anything into it."
578,I'm Going To Ruin This Movie For You,statuskuo,3 January 2020,4,"I had to delete my previous review after considering it for a day...
So folks...here it is...
It's ""Married With Children"" meets ""The Three Stooges"" told with great style and eventually dark violence.
Yes, friends..you've been fooled and somewhat charmed, but it seems the people who've rated this a masterpiece just got a dose of cold reality.
They even mention Chicago, Illinois in the flick. Which is where the 90's show took place. Critics are too dumb with short memories to draw this conclusion, which is why I'll fill you in.
Dad who is underemployed/unemployed, former gloried athlete
Wife has no aspirations to work, has bad housekeeping skills, crass
Son, distances himself from the low-life world of his low life
Sister, street wise and pretty. Uses her sexuality to get thingsI wondered why it felt familiar. In fact, there is an episode where they meet a rich family at a campsite. Also, ""The Simpsons"" had an episode where Homer loses the house to carnys.
So much for originality.
Though you're fooled by a different message of the have and have nots. Which confused me even more. They spent so very little time allowing the family to integrate themselves as ""the rich"" which is how it was sold.
Any way, the message also backfired, considering how despicable the ""poor family"" behaves. The only rationale is that they are so desperate, their actions are forgivable. No, the ends doesn't justify the means. It becomes even MORE muddled when we see the future life that is the possibility, never mind the supposed Morse code feature works only one direction. So if the son is writing a letter to the father, he can't get it. Or maybe we're to assume he left it somewhere where he'd find it. Too many damn questions.SPOILERS!!! Stop reading if you are going to see:I dunno, it's shot well, and it's funny, but there are just questions. As one reviewer had put it ""why do they make dumb decisions?"" Are they trying to say that poor people are dumb? Also, when the old housekeeper comes back, why don't they just join forces? The entire thing was unnecessary and aggravating. Also, what was the end game? To kill the rich people and assume their lives? And the fact that poor Dad snaps and attacks the rich Dad over a stench poor people have? Delaying the bleed out death of his daughter?
Pretty grim stuff.
All I know is neither of these guys scored 4 touchdowns as a fullback for Polk High"
579,Parasite: A Connection That Leeches On To Perhaps The Audience,joshtill-98100,5 February 2020,10,"Parasite was one of the contenders for Best Picture that I was intrigued by. I had only heard good things going in, but nothing of the actual plot points. I came out of this film needing to sit down and process the events that just occurred. Nothing had prepared me for what I just endured. Parasite is truly a different film, with semi-realistic events. Think of it as the very absentminded Ibsen for film. Every plot point in this film seems to bounce off the following event very organically and oddly very calm. Although it gets gruesome towards the finish line, Parasite is a tale of manipulation as well as a lesson in class.The film opens to the Kim family, a very low-class family living in a semi-basement in South Korea. The family consists of Ki-Taek, the father, Chung-Sook, the mother, Ki-Woo, the son, and Ki-jeong, the daughter. They all have low paying jobs as they struggle to maintain a middle-class lifestyle. The house struggles with animal infestation, as Ki-Taek insists that the windows stay open to ensure that the dust from automobiles would get into their house, acting as a bug disenfectant. Min-hyk, Ki-Woo's friend, offers the family a relic from his grandfathers house, a stone, which symbolizes ensures future success and wealth to the family that shelters it.On his final night in town before studying abroad, Min-hyk offers Ki-Woo his job as an English Tutor for the wealthy Park family. Ki-Woo declines due to his lack of degrees, but Min-hyk insists that he create a fake resume with help from Ki-jeong, who excels with her photoshop. Ki-Woo enters the Park's house where the interview is to be held. Yeon-gyo, The mother of the Park Family, trusts him fully as he becomes an English Tutor for Da-hye, the eldest child. On his way out, he notices a painting by the youngest child, Da-song. Ki-Woo, under the alias ""Kevin"" from Mrs. Park, refers his cousin from Illinois named Jessica, who is actually Ki-jeong. Ki-Jeong and Mrs. Park discuss Da-song's artwork and she questions if he had a traumatic experience when the child was younger. Mrs. Park accepts Ki-jeong as Da-song's art therapist.Understanding that they could all infiltrate the Park Family, Ki-Taek comes up with a plan. One night, while exiting the house, the Park's Driver insists on taking Ki-jeong home. She leaves a piece of her clothing in the backseat of the car, in order to get him fired for sexual matter while in his workspace. The driver is soon replaced by Ki-Taek. The maid, Moon-gwang, who lived in the house many years before the Parks, has a severe allergic reaction to peaches that were planted by the Kim family. The Kim's present the evidence as Tuberculosis, ensuring the maid gets fired and replaced by Chung-Sook. The whole family, now working in the house, experience an upper-class living style. The Park Family goes away for a camping trip, leaving the whole house to Chung-Sook, who secretly invites the whole family to live there as well.That night, a heavy downpour begins across town. As the Kim's settle in to the Park House, drinking and eating, Moon-Gwang arrives at the door and pleads to Chung-Sook to let her inside, for she claims to have forgotten an item in the basement. The remaining Kims hide while Chung-Sook goes with Moon-Gwang and helps her move a cupboard, which reveals a secret door. Moon-Gwang opens the door to reveal her husband, Geun-sae, who had been living there for four years, hiding from Loan Sharks. Moon-Gwang pleads Chung-Sook to take care of him, but she declines. The remaining Kim's fall down the stairs and accidentally break the secret that they're all family to Moon-Gwang. She threatens to tell Mr and Mrs. Park, as Chung-Sook gets a phone call from Mrs. Park, who states the family is coming home due to the rain. Ki-Taek swiftly ties Moon-Gwang and Geun-Sae up in the basement and locks them downstairs. The Kim family clean up their mess and hide as the Parks re-enter unaware of the chaos that just ensued.As Chung-Sook cleans up from the dinner prepared for the Parks, Ki-Taek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jeong all hide under the living room table. Da-Song, saddened by the fact that his birthday camping trip was ruined, insists on sleeping outside in his tent, in the midst of the storm. Mr. and Mrs. Park watch from the couch before they both fall asleep. Ki-Taek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jeong successfully sneak out of the house and find their old home flooded shoulder-high. The three gather their belongings as Ki-Woo grabs the stone given to the family for good luck. The three sleep in a gym alongside their previous neighbours.The next morning, Mrs. Park insists on repaying the debt on making Da-Song's birthday fun by creating a last-minute garden party for him. She invites Ki-Jeong, while Da-hye requests Ki-Woo to attend, for they have secretly been in love. Mrs. Park accepts and invites Ki-Taek and Chung-Sook to attend as well. As the party is about to begin, Ki-Woo opens the door to the basement, ready to kill Moon-Gwang and Geun-sae. Geun-Sae gets free and mourns Moon-Gwang who succumbed to her injuries from the fight. Geun-Sae bashes Ki-Woo in the head with the stone and runs to the party, holding a steak knife. He then stabs Ki-Jeong, as Da-Song faints, revealing that Geun-Sae was the ghost that he saw, which created his childhood trauma. As Mr. Park insists that Ki-Taek drive them to the hospital, Ki-Taek murders Mr. Park for not understanding the importance of class. Ki-Taek flees the scene, Ki-Jeong dies from her injuries, Ki-Woo wakes up from a coma a couple of weeks later, alongside Chung-Sook. A few months later, Ki-Woo is walking on a hill by the Park's residence where he sees a message using Morse Code. Ki-Woo decodes it, to reveal that Ki-Taek has trapped himself in the secret basement, going full circle from where the film began.Parasite is a film that has no end. It is a reflection on something that could potentially happen. Bong-Joon-Ho is a revolutionary director and this could be his best film yet. Although the premise may seem a tad dull and anti-climactic (ie. the first half of the film just being about infiltration), the film never loses your interest. A great example is during the films first climactic moment, when the Park's call. The audience is sweating as you watch the father, fighting to ensure that the Parks don't find out about the truth, the children sweeping through broken glass bottles, and the mother who makes dinner. Nothing too much happening and yet, you are so intrigued. I recommend Parasite be seen by everyone.Overall, Parasite gets a 10."
580,The art of the uncomfortable..,yourfriendrahul,13 February 2020,10,"The art of the uncomfortable..
When words and images are not enough to articulate the feel..
'Parasite' is one such powerful, subtle, sublime, sinister (brother.basement.scholar rock) social satire on the class conflict, social inequality, underbelly of capitalism, superficial niceties and the hidden apathy & empathy that this world holds or may be it was always like this..
One hell of a climax and the thought, the question that follows 'why the ending was like this'?
One has to reflect to understand the comedy of ever sinful poverty, appropriation of cultures, shotput, medal, the disgusting flooding, the housekeeper, respect, forgery artist and the simpleton brother laughing..
A little more realization and there you find the ghost, the lights switching on and off, obliviously acting master, the smell of poverty and anchor of the story 'The Morse code' with its knowledge to interchangeable parasite(s) and the host(s)..
Between so much more was said in the unsaid and that is the beauty of this cleverly written, acted, directed Korean tragic, haunting, conflicting, comedy classic..
A must watch👍👍👍"
581,Another Korean masterpiece,z-benkoudad,23 October 2019,10,"Bong Joon-Ho did it again. A true masterpiece in acting and storytelling. You are hooked until the end of the story. Then you'll spend at least an hour after the credits thinking about it !
Avoid spoilers"
582,One of the decade's most clever and original,TheVictoriousV,6 December 2019,10,"South Korean film crews may be World Cinema's most painstakingly dedicated; the movies are detailed and creatively daring in ways that would be impermissible under Hollywood supervision, on top of letting the actors give their all and show their most unflattering selves. As is the case with Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, they might also produce some of our time's most impressively original stories and supply timely commentary in the process.We meet the impoverished Kim family, father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and we soon learn they aren't the most honest bunch. Ki-woo, through his friend Min-hyuk, gets hired as a homeschool English teacher, using forged Oxford documents, at the home of the upper-class Park family; tech company CEO Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun), his stressed-out wife Yeon-gyo (a wonderful Cho Yeo-jeong), teen daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and little Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). This is but the beginning of the Kim family's sneaky ascent.Learning of Da-song's troubles, Ki-woo, going by ""Kevin"", informs Mrs. Park of an art therapist he knows named ""Veronica"", who is actually Ki-jeong, who may help Da-song evolve. Through a series of events I won't spoil, ""Veronica"" later gets the chance to recommend a new chauffeur for the Park family in the form of Ki-taek, going by ""Mr. Kim"", who in turn recommends a new housekeeper, played by Chung-sook.The way the Kims continually fool the Parks - from meticulous script recitations in their basement flat to ad-libbing based on research they've done for the fields they pretend to work in - is clever, tense, impossible to predict, and morbidly hilarious throughout. It is made even more amusing to behold thanks to how it's edited (for instance: cutting from Ki-taek lying to Yeon-gyo, to him finishing the same sentence during Ki-woo's rehearsals), how purposefully the staging and cinematography are done (the vast Park household juxtaposed against the cramped Kim residence), and how utterly believable these performances are.The actors who portray the Kims, in particular, give remarkably layered performances. Each actor is required to play the character in their natural environment, plus the roles they themselves assume when posing as the Park family's home employees.The characters themselves are convincing actors, hence their successful duping of the Parks, which makes each real-world actor's performance all the more considerable. And yes, it seems a bit unlikely that the Parks would fall for the scam and refrain from asking questions when each new employee of theirs happens to know someone suited for a very recently vacated position, but the film is self-aware and deliberate about this, not only because the Parks - in their carefree luxury - aren't the most observant.This is all comical to experience, yes, but what Bong has to say about class inequity and - during the film's bleaker, later scenes - how it isn't necessarily so simple as letting the poor ""have some luxury"" for the sake of fairness, is what makes Parasite stick. We may understand the downtrodden Kims (we learn from a revelation that their desperation is not unique), and laugh at their conniving schemes, but are they truly Sherwoodian heroes in the end?Parasite is generally well-loved, but divisive in the circles you'd expect. My guilty-pleasure film critic Armond White is certain that the film scoffs at nuclear families (also calling it a ""cancel-culture comedy"" because, I guess, anti-family sentiments are common amongst those who also like to ""cancel"" offensive celebrities and, indeed, berate classism). So far as I can decipher, White's main evidence is the fact that, in the story, a traditional and successful family suffers comically at the hands of the semi-titular social parasites - whom he likens to entitled modern Communists and AntiFa terrorists.As mentioned, the Kims aren't strictly heroes or justified. Isn't this a bit like saying Midsommar seeks to paint Swedish tradition as perverse because it has characters (read: villains) who co-opt our customs perversely? But then, psh, who'd reason like that?"
583,A Masterpiece in Filmmaking,kjproulx,28 October 2019,10,"Director Bong Joon Ho has been on my radar for years now, as I believe him to be one of the best storytellers out there right now. Admittedly, I haven't seen the majority of his films but his two most recent works in Snowpiecer and Okja were among the best films of their consecutive years. I thought both of those films were great, so I was very eagerly awaiting his newest film, Parasite. After viewing, not only does this film deserve to be talked about as one of the best films to be released in 2019, but I personally think this may just be the very best movie you'll see all year. Now, some people may not like the turn it takes, but here's why I think Parasite demands to be seen.To go into detail about this premise would be to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, so I'll stick to the basics here. The Kim family lives in a basement living space. All unemployed, they find any way they can to make things work. Ki-woo, the eldest sibling in the family, is given the opportunity to tutor the daughter of the rich Park family. Getting smarter and smarter as the first act really kicks into gear, the Kim family becomes a group of very clever con-artists. Meaning well and doing everything they can to keep things legitimate, this makes for some terrific tension.The biggest praise I can give this film is that it's constantly in motion, never wasting a moment to surprise you. The set-up for this movie has many clever aspects to it, the second act throws you a real curveball and the finale doesn't disappoint either. Some viewers may think this movie goes off the rails toward the end, but I found it to be an overall brilliant piece of storytelling. Each time you think the movie has said everything it wants to, it becomes that much more interesting. In other hands, this story could've have come off as a very generic film, but there's truly something special about how well-made Parasite is.Wonderfully shot by cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong, each frame of this movie has more than one thing to say. It's very rare these days that shot compositions are done in such a way that they seem to tell a story as well, but even in the moments when the focus is on the characters alone, there are things happening in the background or even signs in the framing that things are coming soon. This movie is brilliantly made in every way.It's very rare when I review a film and struggle to at least come up with one negative here, so I won't bother trying, because I loved this movie too much to let anything take away from it. I will just say that certain aspects may not work for everyone. Parasite is a perfect example of why I love movies so much. A great, engaging story that surprises you from start to finish, along with one of the best crews to work on a film yet this year. I can't praise this film enough. This Korean language film has broken through and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it takes home the award for best foreign film and even a nomination for best picture. This is as close to a masterpiece you can get today."
584,Parasite is the film you have to watch at least once in your life.,arishsankar,22 August 2019,10,"Parasite' is absolutely fantastic. I'm still buzzing how good this movie is. This film is a milestone for Korean cinema. Just watch this with your own eyes. I can bet you will never forget this. I have never seen a film where one can present the deeply rooted social class boundaries not just in Asian countries but all over the world in such an entertaining and engaging way.""You know what kind of plan that never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned."""
585,Overrated but worth one watch,payzillee,16 February 2020,6,"I enjoyed this film but I don't think it's the masterpiece that critics have made it out to be. I didn't get the numerous multiple genres from this that others have claimed it has. It's effectively a crime flick with a poor family conning a rich family with some social commentary thrown in. I suppose the ending is a bit more thriller/horror.The story is entertaining enough, some of the imagery is lovely and it's well acted. See it but don't expect it to be the best film of the year."
586,Parasite (2019),fntstcplnt,5 February 2020,9,"Directed by Bong Joon-ho. Starring Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Chang Hyae-jin, Park So-dam, Cho Yeo-jeong, Lee Sun-kyun, Lee Jung-eun, Jeong Ji-so, Park Myung-hoon, Jung Hyeon-jun, Park Seo-joon, Park Geun-rok. (R)Teen-aged Choi, from a lower-class, unemployed family, deceives his way into a position as tutor for the daughter within the prosperous Park family; soon, the rest of his family begins ingratiating (and insinuating) themselves into the Park's lives. To tell more would spoil the pleasures of this deliciously demented parable on class, greed, prejudice and more. As expected from a Bong Joon-ho film, the tone boldly changes at will (mostly between hysterical satire and nerve-wracking thriller), but the transitions are more fluid than ever before for the talented filmmaker--or perhaps it's just because the story and technique is so gripping. Meticulously designed and flawlessly performed by its cast (the first foreign-language group to ever score the ensemble cast award from the Screen Actors Guild), its audacious tangle of ideas and statements packaged with artful, precise elegance. Some of the metaphors come off as shopworn in their exactness, but the film is so otherwise ingeniously constructed that it takes effort to recall in the aftermath exactly how the incidents all piled up. Amusing scriptwriting workshop exercise idea: present the first twenty minutes and last twenty minutes of the movie and see how someone tries to navigate a connection between the endpoints.91/100"
587,Am I missing something?,pppanda88,9 September 2019,7,"I watched ""Parasite"" a Korean film last night. I have been hearing how great this movie is and how IMDB rating is 8.5 IGN 9.5 Rotten Tomatoes giving it 100%. Well, am I missing something? I do think it's a good film but almost a perfect 10 I don't feel that. The actions of the main family seems so realist. The story, the way it's written, and just the performance of the actors is good. You can imagine that something like this can maybe happen to people that is just gullible. But I felt like everything was very predictable. But some questions were unanswered Like, Why was the original house keeper (Moon-gwang) face messed up? Why the little boy (Park Da-song) have special sense in smell with all of them and Why was he so wild in the beginning and calm and good later on? Why did the father (Kim Ki-taek) have an odor that smells so bad that it couldn't be disguised or washed off? I do like the Director (Joon-ho Bong) and other films he had made but I just feel like this movie is more a 6.5 / 7 for me."
588,Awful,chiguy17,17 April 2020,3,"Really, one of the worst, most drawn out films I've ever seen. The people touting it as a 10 are pseudo-intellectuals trying to construct something that just wasn't there - like the amateur critics on here who think of themselves as legit film critics. I'm sorry, the film just doesn't deserve the hype or accolades, and most certainly not the Academy Award (even for foreign language film, let alone Best Film).I was expecting something deeply profound and artistic, and this just wasn't either of those things. This is a horrible example of trying to expand one's cinematic palate to foreign films, because there are wonderful foreign films out there. I'm guessing the people that liked this also thought ""Mother"" was some sort of mind blowing masterpiece."
589,Best movie of the year,justin-fencsak,9 February 2020,10,If you like Asian cinema and are curious about which movie to see before tonight's oscar ceremony then this movie is a must see. Despite being a Korean movie with subs it has a lot of excitement and drama to make it an upset at tonight's telecast.
590,Simply amazing,billo_zeidan,26 October 2019,10,"This is my first experience with a Korean movie and I believe that I started with the best.
This movie is amazing very simple but yet full of everything and all kinds of feelings the movie starts as a comedy it ends in a very dramatic way that you could never expect and the transition between the two phases was very smooth.
The acting is very high level not a bit less than all A-list stars in Hollywood.
Everybody must watch this movie."
591,132 minutes of perfectly measured film,uwalvin,9 January 2020,10,"Like a five star dish, every minute of this film is superb, respecting the time it asks of you, the viewer, as it takes you through a roller coaster of highs and lows. It is not overly dramatic nor does deplete you emotionally, which is my typical fear with Korean dramas and thrillers. I must reiterate that you will not leave this movie with a sense of innocence lost, like your first reading of The Lord of the Flies or your first watching of Oldboy. The comedy cuts through the perfectly balanced two hours and change experience that Bong Jong Ho has prepared for you.Avoid spoilers at all costs and dive in at the marvel of the story it can tell within two hours, as Hollywood struggles with two part films and making coherence out of overly packed blockbusters like Star Wars.Perhaps a permanent entry into the Top 250 films of all time."
592,Parasite film review (2019) by Screams and Whispers,leonardsargsyan,12 February 2020,10,"Synopsis: Kim Ki-woo lives on the edge of poverty with his family. They steal WiFi from their neighbors, work on minimum wage jobs and live in a basement apartment. Kim Ki-woo's life changes when he gets an offer from his friend to work as an English tutor, because the friend was going to study abroad. The friend is infatuated with the girl and wants his friend be around during his absence to avoid others being around his crush. The young man accepts the offer, changes his name to Kevin and starts tutoring Park Da-hye, who quickly falls in love with ""Kevin"". Once among the Parks, Kevin develops a different plan:he want to get his family into the Park family. Will he succeed to get his poor family into the Parks? If yes, will the Kims, the poor family, become as rich and privileged as the Parks?
Parasite, by Bong Joon Ho, is the film of the year. It won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. Apart from its numerous accolades, Parasite won 4 awards at the 92nd Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature film. This is the first non-English language film to win Best Picture Award. It won as the Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Golden Globe Awards. It won the Best Film Not in the English Language and the Best Original Screenplay awards at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards.A bell sounds right at the beginning of the film is there to verify if all the speakers of the theater function properly or not. The bell is there to be compared to the plurality of voices a society produces. Like the bell, there are many others symbols in this film that deserve to be studies closely.The food in the film often symbolizes the same notion of ""up and down"". The noodles, the cheaper food, are made for Kim family, while the beef, the expensive one, is for the Parks. The rain in the film plays the same role as the food. It emphasizes the opposite perceptions that individuals from two different social classes have about the same thing and how that same thing influences them differently.
Water symbolizes the reality and the stone symbolizes false hopes. Water always goes down and not up and can damage those who live ""down"", the poor. This was the case when the strong rain came and damage the Kims' house.Parasite foreshadowing: the scene, where the fumigation happens, the daughter attempts to close the window, but the father tells not to, because it is a ""free extermination"". Everyone starts coughing, except from the father. During another occasion, the daughter says that she fit in well with the Parks, but ironically she is the first to die. When it comes to the father, he is the only one to continue his life in the basement, just like he was the only one, who was not afraid of the smoke. When it comes to the Indian theme, it is a foreshadowing for the fate of the Parks family.
Bong Joon-ho doesn't portray the rich as villains neither the poor as victims. The borderline between the bad and the good is opaque: we do not know for which character we should cultivate the most empathy. Deep down, they may all have the same insecurities and worldview with very slight differences...apart from the smell..., because ""they all smell the same"" according to the Parks. Is it because of the subway, or the soap they use, or the basement smell? It is just a metaphor: the smell symbolizes the poor. By the way, during birthday festivities, the father of the Parks family is killed by the father of the Kims family following his disgust towards the smell of their first housekeeper's husband.
One of the highly used symbols is the concept of ""up and down"" or ""high and low"" for class representation. Parks' house is located at the highest point of the town. The upper-class family of Parks rarely looks down on the floor. They always look forward or up, which means that their house's employees hide easily under their tables, in the ground-floor or elsewhere if/when they feel that hiding is necessary. The notion of ""parasite"" is recurrent and questions what exactly it means. Who exactly is ""parasite"": the poor or the rich. Are there any parasites? What if everybody are parasites?
One of the most important points of this film is the fact that people fight against each other. Even those, who are down, fight mercilessly for keeping their place in the Parks's house even if it means living in the basement. They lack a lot of solidarity.Parks' son has an obsession with native Americans. For his birthday, the native american theme is highly used. It represents a surprise: just like the Kims discover that there is a family living rights in the basement of the Parks's house, the Europeans had discovered that there were native Americans living in the newly discovered continent. In both cases the result was the war and/or the fight. Moreover, during the festivities, Kim Ki-woo checks if the other family's father is in the basement taking the stone, which was given to him by his friend as a symbol of success, symbolizing the hope for a better future, with him. The stone is only used to smash someone's head and never brings success.
The closing scene shows Kim Ki-woo. In his letter to his father, Kim Ki-woo says that he will work until he could afford to buy the mansion and adds:""All you'll need to do is to walk up the stairs"". These expressions summarizes the myth of social mobility and supports social determinism."
593,Best movie of the year,zianrabbani-99498,23 December 2019,10,"Unquestionably the best movie of the year and the best foreign movie I've ever seen. A complete rollercoaster ride . Laughter, anxiety and sadness, felt all in 2 hours. Cinematography was amazing specially for the flood secenes. Memories of murder was one of the greatest foreign films I've ever seen and Boon Joon-Ho has managed to make another masterpiece."
594,Holy Moly,MamadNobari97,21 December 2019,10,"Out of 814 movies that I rated on this site, I only gave 9 of them the full 10/10 and this movie is one of them, so you go figure."
595,"Good, but really a masterpiece?",Winter_Nights_,27 October 2019,7,"For shure it's a good movie.
The production is great ( visual, audio, cut).
But the story started great and end up a little flat.
Also the critic about capitalism could be sharper."
596,Best movie of the year. Clearly Oscar Worthy.,akjaiswalsrk,10 February 2020,10,"Bong joon ho gives you everything in this movie. Laughs, Suspense, Disgust, Empathy, Shock and Hope. The message is so woven into the film and subtle. Hardly a flaw in the film. The film does not talk down to it's audience and presents characters who are not your stereotypical rich and poor. The movie makes you think, a deep long think. The runtime of 132 mins is hardly noticeable in this fast faced storytelling with a crisp screenplay. Bong Joon Ho is hands down one of the best directors of our times. Deserves all the accolades it has been garnering."
597,Parasite: Is there Really a Such Thing in the Human Definition?,RayCharles81,13 February 2020,6,"When people think of a parasite, they obviously associate it with a lesser living creature living off of its larger, more prosperous host. For example, fleas live on dogs and consume their blood.According to society, which is constructed in a way that the most educated are burdened with defining the meaning of words, a parasite is a person who consumes resources off of another without returning anything. At least so it says, right?Well, what if an economic recession hits and people lose their jobs and no longer have a way of making the money they need to in order to repay whoever it is they are working for? What if they experience an illness, injury, or health problem (in addition to that bad economic situation) which deems them unable to even work productively (at least for a while)? What if the ""host"" that the so-called ""parasite"" human is borrowing resources from is actually a ""bad person"" themselves who ""abuses"" them both emotionally, verbally, and physically in order to boost their ""egos"" to make themselves feel superior to the person they are ""helping""?....Is there actually a parasitic human, or are all people just human?Take for instance someone who is born into poverty, physically or mental abuse, or both. Are they parasites just because of this? Things they had no control over? Just because they are poor? What if this person decides to not make excuses and gets a job, but a recession hits that causes them to lose their job? Were they not a parasite before but now after they lose their job, which they cannot help, they are now?Perhaps most complexly, what if they people ""at the top"" are actually the ""Parasites""? (if there was one). Isn't it true that government workers and ""politicians"" live off of ""taxpayer money"" (aka taxpayer labor)? Isn't it true that a mega-rich corporate leader consumes the labor of their subordinates in order to make exponentially more money off of them?Doesn't this luxurious CEO or executive ""suck the blood"" and ""life"" out of their workers by forcing them to work harder, work overtime, sometimes work 60 hours a week or more (with the threat they will be demoted or lose their jobs if they do not)? And isn't it true that due to increase production or productivity, the executive makes even more money on the backs of their employees? Furthermore, cannot the corporation hold onto the laborers' paychecks for at least 2 weeks in order to reinvest it in stocks before paying it out to those who earned it two weeks prior as they wait for their paychecks?Many years ago, a very startling and eye opening book came out which actually compared corporations to psychopaths. All of the traits in an empirical psychopath are parallel to exactly how corporations are run, and also how corporate executives operate: they callously mistreat their employees, can care less about their health or well being as long as they are greedily and selfishly getting wealthier and growing. As a corporation becomes bigger, the dichotomy between caring for a small group of employees and eventually becoming indifferent to any humanity and well being of the individuals (which also includes the customers) becomes starker in contrast. All that matters is personal selfish gain in an overabundance unnecessary amount of riches, as their employees struggle to pay their bills each pay period and have to wait two weeks often times for their checks. If they lay people off or if the corporation downsizes or relocates, then the employees are back to barely getting by with no check.So the question again must be asked: who ""really"" is the Parasite? Either there are none, or everyone is."
598,Honest review. Overrated,m-jan,4 December 2019,2,"It's overrated, it doesn't deserve to be in 250 at all, nor does it deserve to be higher rated than 6. There is no point, the first few minutes are funny, then predictable. You will be waiting for something to happen to justify that above 8 rating and show why it's on 250, but nothing happens. It is entertaining a bit"
599,Best plan is not having one,danielcereto,3 September 2019,10,This is a great Korean little gem. The storyline is simply amazing and I suggest not read anything before you watch it. I did it and I have enjoyed every single minute of the movie. Best plan is not having one.
600,WHAT AN EXPERIENCE,KeremUlucay,21 January 2020,9,"Palme d'Or winner Parasite is a masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho. That movie is so skilled. Screenplay is amazing, I think it is best original screenplay of 2019 next to Knives Out. It takes you inside of it at the beginning and then you can never leave. Cast made an incredible job. Actually I can't find any bad things to say about Parasite. It is great."
601,Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps,ketgup83,11 January 2020,8,"The Oscar fever has started and it is my favourite time of the year where I get to watch the films which is engaging, clap-worthy, entertaining and relatable.
Parasite was already in buzz for sometime which caught my attention and to my surprise turned out to better than expected after seeing it.Parasite tells the story of differences in the mindset between the Upper class and Lower class families which is very much existing in our society.
As the name of the film itself, the movie gives a detailed account of how an unemployed family is influenced by the lifestyle of a wealthy rich family and eventually enters into their house
only to get the shock of their life.Directed by Bong Joon Ho, who made Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite boast off characters which you can easily relate to. A poverty driven family comprising of
a struggling father, Kim, and mother, tech savvy son and a careless sister - who goes the wrong path to enter the house of a rich family but ultimately face the consequences.
The film slowly and eventually picks up as each member from the poor family starts getting the job in the house of rich, by falsely accusing the old staffs. The main
drama unfolds when the rich guys go for a vacation and the Kim's family take over the house and celebrate their win. However, they meet with an unfortunate incident when one of the
old staff comes back which changes their plan completely. This is where the film kicks-off when the rich guys cut short their trip and plan to come back which leads
to series of uninvited events, leading to more excitement and thrills you never expected.If you go the wrong way, you have to face the consequence and that is what the director Bong Joon Ho showed in his film when Kim's loses one of his family member
and ultimately face the redemption. Hats of to Bong Joon Ho for creating a beautiful drama with relatable characters, humorous situations and a powerful storyline with a strong message.
There are couple of scenes which is executed brilliantly - when two staff families meet at the basement, the flood scene depicting the behavior of Kim's family - Kim picking
up in stuff, son grabbing his favourite stone and daughter lighting her cigeratte even though the house is in mess. The beauty of cinema lies in the story-telling
and this is where Parasite scores.Technically, Parasite has a wonderful background score with lovely cinematography. Editing is superb, though I felt few scenes could have been trimmed. Art direction
is brilliant while dialogues are outstanding. Performances wise - I felt all the actors played their part while but if I had to pick up, my favourite would be
Kang-ho Song, who plays the role of father of the unemployed family.Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4/5"
602,I watched it for the 5th time,alansabljakovic-39044,15 January 2020,10,"This time I watched it in theatre with very annoying crowd. They laughed all the time but the reaction to second half of the movies was priceless (everyone was like wtf is happening). Oscars not nominating Kang-ho Song for best supporting actor is a disgrace.
Also, it deserved at least cinematography nomination but whatever."
603,Pleasantly disturbing,patcostello2006,22 January 2020,9,"Watched on a flight after the Oscars. Curious.
It starts slow, there are subtitles, but you are quickly adapted to the the films rhythym. I know nothing of this culture but it is a story of humans The loyalty and love we share in our family. Choices are made, levers tripped, situations develop...
Both families are endearing. There are some light and humorous scenes. There are also a few 'oh come on' risks akin to a sitcom, but that's how we get from there to 'holy crap what is happening here' so must take that leap with the director.
The cinematography is beautiful, the pace is good but you need to pay attention. the dialogue is all valuable-
When we get to the last third, it all comes together quickly. Enjoy the ride.
You haven't seen a film like this before"
604,Crime & Class,MogwaiMovieReviews,1 December 2019,8,"An impoverished family finds ways to worm themselves into a wealthy household, until an unexpected turn of events throws their plans into disorder._________Parasite is the best Korean film I've seen for quite awhile, though it's not without its flaws. Even allowing for poor translation, a good deal of the dialogue is weak and hard to follow, several plot threads are introduced that don't go anywhere or end up being satisfactorily explained, and too many elements (the morse code, for instance) stretch credulity and feel crowbarred in because they are necessary for the story the makers want to tell, rather than making any sense *within* that story.But for all that, Parasite reminds me of everything that is so great and different about Korean cinema: a twisted, amoral, mischevious inventiveness, interspersing thoroughly leftfield turns with out-of-nowhere snatches of shocking and perfectly choreographed violence that make you involuntarily laugh out loud in both horror and admiration (in this instance, at a kick down some stairs). I honestly never saw the twist in this one coming at all, and it's a doozy, taking the film in an entirely different direction to what I'd been expecting.Though not as great as its accompanying hype is saying, Parasite is still one of the most original and enjoyable films this year and definitely worth a look."
605,How'd this turkey win an Oscar?,dmcknapp,29 November 2022,No rating,"Long before Parasite ended (I had to grit my teeth to hang on till the finish) I had diagnosed Bong Joon-ho with ADHD. The film is like a random collage of different ways to approach the story: slapstick, hard-hitting social commentary, mystery, comedy of manners, tear-jerker or thriller.There's a lot of good acting, but the psychological climate keeps changing before you can start to feel any connection with a character's situation. It reminded me of Thai movies 50 years ago, where every production had to cover all the bases: romance, crime, thrilling chases, and lots of hilarious (well, meant meant to be hilarious) comic relief. This wasn't as much fun. At the end, I had no interest in what lay wait for the characters after the finale, but I was very happy. I only rented the film."
606,A dumb bunch of Marxist propaganda,TheNabOwnzz,28 November 2019,6,"Parasite, directed by Joon-Ho Bong, director of the excellent character study 'Memories of Murder' received an about 8 minutes long standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival. It also seems to be widely known now as a 'masterpiece', a term that flows easily these days. However, the truth is that it is simply a mediocrity, and the only reason this acclaim is received seems to be for the fact that it appeals to Marxist nut jobs because it deems poor people to be superior to rich people.Now, Bong doesn't depict our four protagonists as angels. On the contrary, they are scheming, immoral, disgusting, conniving, backstabbing low lifes, but the salient issue here is the fact that, especially in the later phases of the film, Bong wants the audience to feel pity for these four morons. Of course, our poor 'heroes' manage to scheme into a rich household in an extremely absurd & easy matter, made even easier by the gullible nature of the rich. Herein lies another problem. Standard human behavior is altered in order to fit Bong's sociological narrative, meaning that the rich man & woman are indeed too stupid to figure out anything, whereas a bunch of lazy criminal nut jobs who can't even fold a pizza box properly are genius in their scheming. It makes no logical sense, and suspension of disbelief can be a good thing, but not when it is made for a ham fisted social message. That's simply a lack of creativity in writing.There's also of course the far fetched plot points.. such as the secret door behind the bookcase. That nobody in the house has figured that out in four years is really something that stretches beyond suspension of disbelief, and the fact that someone was down there all the time is even dumber, not to mention the revelation near the end when the dad takes the guys's place. They're not exactly plot holes, but they are illogicalities that are another result of the very poor screenplay.In the technical aspects, Parasite doesn't disappoint as much, as the photography is adequate, coupled with an excellent score & generally good cinematography. Thus, it is alright to look at, but it is impossible to overlook the glaring holes in the substantial aspects. The acting is good for the most part, especially by the rich wife, who was however a completely idiotic and unbelievable hysterical character, further decreasing the subtleties between the depiction of the classes.In the end, Parasite was created as a depiction of class struggle, and while it does show the poor people as wicked creatures, Bong nonetheless deems it necessary with his narrative that we as an audience should care for them, even though they deserve every single evil they can get. We, as the audience, are supposed to judge based on class distinction which people are good and which people are bad, as opposed to something like character development, which generally is the more important thing."
607,Every film lover needs to see this at least once or twice,HBSmith_Writer,17 December 2019,10,"Director Bong Joon-ho, the wildly innovative foreign director behind ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"" has outdone himself with ""Parasite""- An original and profound look at class warfare that among many things is meticulously crafted, seamlessly blends drama and dark humor with several of the best performances I've seen all year.If you can get past that this isn't spoken in English, fellow film fans will be in for a real treat come awards season (or whenever it comes to streaming, because missing this would be a crime).This may just be favorite movie of the year, depending on after I see ""The Irishman"". Review for that coming soon!Grade- A+"
608,Very good movie,ashtechservices,15 February 2020,7,"This is a very good movie, but not a masterpiece. I really like the story and the actors were pretty good. I would never expect this film to win an Oscar. I guess the politics has entered the Oscars for good.

609,Below average movie,johnleolee,10 April 2020,2,Whoever calls it a masterpiece just don't know meaning of masterpiece at all. I don't understand how this movie got oscar. It's just very normal average movie. Too much hype for this average movie.

613,"instant classic, this generation's Rules of the Game",trelerke-politics,7 November 2019,10,"As Jordan Peele is to race, Bong Joon-ho is to class. He creates strange, shocking scenes and stories from the seemingly mundane. A fancy house with an underground, with an underground prisoner. This is about how human civilization is the Parasite that drives everyone absolutely crazy. There will always be those few who essentially live off everyone else, the main point though, is we all suffer, maybe there is no solution but it really is this ugly, ultimately. The pin-head wife lives in oblivious vapidness, going on about the swan formation of tables for her spoiled son's birthday. A birthday party called the day after a hellish flood, well, at least a hellish flood that drives everyone in a working class ghetto to an evacuation center. Sewage backing up, blowing out the toilet,it's like the last scenes of the movie Titanic, except far less tidy, while the rich family enjoys the rain on their mountain top mansion. But far more is happening in a very small space, the con family is trapped under the coffee table as the rich couple watches their son's little Indian idyll play on in the Teepee on the lawn in the beautiful rain. (this focus on using American Indians as the spoiled child's play, forcing the fraud family to participate or else, is a masterstroke, as the play became real, toy symbol turned into actual violence). Switching back in time, the fraud family and the underground family essentially fight to the death. Bong Joon-ho mimetically has above ground and the underground and the naive disgust the wealthy have for how the poor smell. It's a little over the top, but in a way that is Brechtian, in showing the contradictions of our materialistic existence. Major props to Bong Joon-ho, it will be a classic."
614,"Without spoiling it, Parasite is the amazing film equivalent to ""Is it wrong to steel bread to feed a starving family?""",RforFilm,14 November 2019,10,"If there's an argument that's been a part of society since the dawn of time is that of class. From the days of cavemen, the Roman Empire, the Enlightment, and even modern times, philosophers, scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor. It's something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all. It's hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that's its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong. There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa. This is also something that many movies has dived into.In fact, one of my favorite movies of the 2000's is the science-fiction thriller, Snowpiercer. It was a creative way to look at corrupted societies and how it unfavorably placed the poor without a way out. It's a movie with a lot of layers and Korean director Boon Joon-Ho knew it was important to make it just as entertaining as it was to explore and read into. It looks like he's made another movie about class, except Parasite is a smaller story about two families, but is still as impactful.We start with a family of four living in the slums, in a basement under a store; father Kim Ki-Taek (played by Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (played by Jang Hye-jin), son Kim Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Kim Ki-Jeong (played by Park So-dam). They struggle for work enough that they take jobs constructing pizza boxes. When a friend of the son comes to visit, he offers Kim Ki-woo an English tutoring job to a wealthy family's daughter. He accepts and sees a world he only dreamt of; a fancy house built by a famous architect, wide space, a backyard and nice cars.After some convincing from the family, a scheme is made so that the daughter is hired as an art therapist for the youngest son, the father as a new driver/errand runner, and the mother as the new housekeeper. The family is overjoyed that their con has fooled the other family. This leads into them celebrating when the other family leaves for a camping trip by eating and drinking in the living room. Things go wrong when the previous housekeeper returns to get something.Though there is a second half to the movie, I can't talk about it without spoiling it. Parasite is one of those movies that spans a lot of genres, and yet keeps it focused enough to make it one of the best movies of 2019. It may sound like a typical dark comedy, but because the character development focuses on all four members of the family, it allowed the story to go in a variety of directions that I didn't expect. At the front, this is still a story on class difference. A lot of these movies will revolve around the theme of ""helping the poor"". Thankfully, Parasite is a smarter movie and tries something different.Parasite doesn't try to make the wealthy family out to be villains. But they don't try to paint the main family in a complete positive light either. These are all grey characters that are simply living life and the lengths their going to climb up. This could mean conning themselves into good jobs or getting a party together for a child. If anything, it tries to lean into how stabbing others in the back to get what they want is bad, but even that can depend on a number of factors. This movie is the prime example of ""would you steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family"".Not only is the movie written and directed beautifully, but it's acted amazingly. Though the movie is in Korean, you can tell the actors are still giving it their all as they each understand the complexities of their situation and why each one would make the decisions they make. This also remains one of the better ensemble pieces I've seen this year, hence why I'm not naming them one by one. I noticed this as well in Snowpiercer with how Bong Joon-ho knows how to cast as a whole and work with what he has.I'll give this ten fancy houses out of ten. It may be in a different language, but this is already one of my favorite movies of the year. This is the kind of movie that can be hard to describe, but my best bet is to simply tell others to see it. I feel like that even talking about it a little could ruin it. Check it out and see just how complicated class difference really is."
615,What my husband and I have known for years!,MissuzT,11 February 2020,10,"Just the rest of the world, and the academy, catching up with what my husband and I have known for years: Korean writers are absolute masters at plot twists and characterization! If you don't agree, watch a few more Korean movies to get adjusted to the cultural differences, and you'll see."
616,Only average,fabi-39534,23 February 2020,6,"Average movie and I still don't get it how this movie won the academy award for the best motion picture of the year.
It felt like it would never end."
617,UNLIKE EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN,filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin,28 December 2019,10,"Parasite is such a fantastic movie that even its comparison with other amazing works can be dangerous. Korean director Bong Joon-ho has such control over the narrative and the camera that we often feel in a Hitchcock or Tarantino movie or even Italian neorealism. And it all flows smoothly.The film begins as a custom comedy. Kim Ki-woo's family (Choi Woo-sik) lives so far below the poverty line in Korean society, that resides in a basement. They're always trying to capture wifi signals from surface neighbors, or leaving the windows open to benefit from the plagues fumigation made by the city hall on the streets.The boy's life experiences a turnaround when a friend who is taking a trip abroad indicates him as a tutor to a girl he is teaching English. The friend is in love with the girl and trusts Kim, who knows why, to keep her safe.Changing his name to Kevin, the boy begins his classes at the magnificent home of the fancy family, and, as expected, the girl Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso) soon falls in love with him. But your dream is much more ambitious: getting a job for your whole family in the house.First, he convinces the girl's mother Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong in great acting) to hire an art psychologist named Jessica, actually her sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) for the hyperactive younger son. Using tricks, the Kim family's father and mother are soon admitted to the house. And on a Parks trip, they celebrate at their ""new"" residence.After that apparent happy ending, everything changes in the movie. Former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) returns home and brings with her a great secret hidden until then. The outbreak of this surprise causes scenes worthy of a thriller, which only ends with the unexpected return of the Parks. What follows are comical scenes and amenities, until the terrible birthday of little boy Da-son (Hyun-jun Jung).From there, chaos, destruction, and despair. And an ending. Or would it be two?"
618,class warfare,SnoopyStyle,4 January 2020,7,"The Kim family leeches off others and lives in a basement apartment. The son Ki-woo gets a job tutoring a young girl. Using a series of lies, each member of the Kim family gets a job at the rich Park family home.I actually found the Kim family too annoying to watch at the beginning. The pizza box incident reminds me of some real life people who are impossible to work with. It's frustrating to sit through. It took a couple of tries. I prefer my grifting with better humor and better style. This family is just annoying. Pizza girl should never hire them for anything. It does get better. There is better humor and I get more in tune with the movie as it continues. I would prefer the driver to be less horny. He needs to be a complete saint. In fact, the rich family needs to be perfect at first so that they can slowly reveal their flaws. Also, they need to lay down the ghost story much earlier and sprinkle in some clues. The twist is unforeseen. That's mostly good but it would be better if the audience can suspect something like that. I do like the smell aspect. It's foreshadowed well and has a great build-up. There are scenes which I can almost smell. This is a very compelling statement about class in society."
619,Not that great,potterstarexpedientes,9 February 2020,1,"I am sorry, I didn't like it...It could have been great, the topics were valid, but it was just not good. I don't think it was a masterpiece, at the end it was all over the place and you missed the point.
The story was not good either.
I have to disagree with the rest of the world."
620,The Best Film in Years.,Movie-ManDan,14 November 2019,10,"Maybe it's just me, but I have known a decline in film quality since 2017. 2016 was a very good year for film--the last great year altogether. Have I simply seen too many films? In 2016 and earlier, There were a whole bunch of films that I could say ""now that is one of the very best films I have ever seen."" Since 2017, the most that I could say about I film I love would have been ""I love this film. But I don't adore it...One of the best of the year, not ever."" Finally near the end of the decade comes a film I can comfortably say is one of the finest motion pictures I have ever laid eyes on.The movie is Korean so there are subtitles and it does run over two hours. But throughout that duration, time stands still. We are fully immersed in this tale of Shakespearean portions and Hitchcockian brains.'Parasite' follows two families: the dirt poor Kims and the filthy rich Parks. Being on opposite ends of the social spectrum, many people interpret this as a social satirical film. I can see where they are coming from, but I didn't care about that. Many different themes such as identity are also looked at, but that is all just icing on the cake. Placing them on opposite ends of the spectrum just makes the story and characters another relationships all the more great.it is sad seeing the Kims in such bad living conditions, so we root for them right away to get out of the slums. Ki-woo is the son who aspires to get out of poverty by attending university. He is approached by one of his university friends who is going overseas to study to take over tutoring Park Da-hye in english. Ki-woo does not know English well, but figures he can fake it and make some money. he may be just a tutor, but it pays well. He finds out that the Parks are looking for a therapist for their son, so Ki-woo gets his sister to assume a new identity and be the boy's therapist. With more money coming and only two more people in the Kim family in need of a good job, it all seems like a sinch to get them in. But getting rid of people in their way and keeping their true identities under wraps from the Parks will be harder than they could fathom.'Parasite' could be simplified as ""family vs family"" but there are a couple of more characters other than the regular family members that are all so interesting. Most movies cannot handle developing these many characters. They are smart, sympathetic, even likeable.The reason I call this film ""Hitchcockian"" is because of its power to thrill us and take the viewer to places they could never imagine. Even when a movie is unpredictable, the payoffs are plausible and the viewer is able to tie things together easily. But with this, each time a twist comes (which is frequent) the viewer is still left flabbergasted and completely caught off guard. The director really pulls out the rug from underneath.Watching this movie was such a breath of fresh air and director, Bong Joon-Ho could easily have messed up at any moment. But there is not one second of wasted or subpar material. In fact, it it just the opposite: the movie keeps building and just gets better by the minute. The thrills get stronger and stronger as the twists get smarter and more intricate. With all that happens 'Parasite' becomes an imservie film experience that you will never forget.4/4"
621,Simply mesmerising,hutch_delaney,19 January 2020,10,"This film had me hooked from the beginning. A fast-paced, and well thought out storyline. No details were left unanswered in my eyes. Brilliant and humble acting from all the cast with believable characteristics and flaws. The subtitles throughout are worth it for what is unveiled during the film."
622,Goes bigger by going smaller,cliftonofun,4 November 2019,10,"Bong Joo Ho has been making ingenious social commentary for some time. That is not new. But this film reaches new heights, not through more extravagant plot but through a more naturalistic approach. As a result, the comedy, the stakes, and the insights here are at a different level. You care about the protagonists, and you feel the weight of their struggle. All the same ingredients are there (the social satire, the violence, the bizarre twists, the brilliant direction), but there's a new weight to this film. I don't think ""masterpiece"" is too strong, and I'm looking forward to watching it again some time soon."
623,The very best movie of the decade.,karajan1714-326-881626,10 February 2020,10,"This film is such a perfect masterpiece in every facet that one cannot be but astounded and has become interested in everything Korean. I am in love with Korean language, with its sweet words-enunciation, the cadence, the soft and musical ending of every sentence. However,the less one read about the movie beforevwatchng it, the better. Go and see it, you won't regret"
624,Overwhelming as hell,cinish,27 January 2020,10,"Movie starts off with a very intimate portrayal of the poverty and the vigor of the first family. Mastery is very evident.The rich family is portrayed next with just as much intimacy and depth.The story starts unfolding, the deviousness is a bit disturbing when it begins. Intimate portrayal is about showing everything, not just the stuff that gets the audience to like the protagonists. Bong Joon Ho is ruthless in his script and making.The excesses of the rich is contrasted sharply with the abysses of the poor.There is so much to this movie that the various departments of the movie like cinematography, music etc don't make it to the plane of consideration on the review table. Shocking movie. Must watch. Amazing content, amazing execution!"
625,Everyone needs to see this movie!,DylanCanonge,17 December 2019,10,"This film is a masterpiece, a cinematic slap. Parasite is cinematic perfection. It's not just my favourite film of the year, it's in my top 5 of my best movies of the last decade. Just when you think you know what type of movie it is, it suddenly becomes a completely different movie when you least expect it. Crazy, funny, incredibly smart. I loved it. I've tried to keep my review to a minimum because the less said about this movie the better, everyone needs to see this movie !"
626,Pinter didn't come to Korea,thomas-leitha,19 February 2020,6,"What ever brought this movie its Palm and its Oscar, I couldn't find it on the screen, and no I am not offended, neither by its story nor its violence.

628,Wrong Best Picture Choice for 2019,jgcorrea,13 March 2023,7,"This movie did resonate with its audience, it did get critical acclaim, it did win a bunch of awards, but then, guess what, I reckon I'm the edgy, white person who starts saying it's idiotic and/or overrated. I think that the primary Oscar should have gone to The Irishman, or Once upon a time... In Hollywood, or
1917 (Nineteen seventeen), or Mr. Jones, or Dark waters, or
The lighthouse, or Sorry we missed you, or Richard Jewell
Glass, or even Downton Abbey - the motion picture. The ACademy likes to give out Oscars to movies that push the ""correct"" political opinion. This has nothing to do with the so-called 7th art anymore."
629,another way too overated film,grumpy-3,11 February 2020,1,"First off the film is half and hour too long, most of the dialogue is simplistic and repetitive. how it won best screenplay is beyond me. the film has no heart or soul, we do not care for the poor family, as they are all self serving, uninteresting and as the title says parasites. they go from bumbling incompetents to master con artists, as other have pointed out the rich family are presented as really stupid, unaware of what is happening around them. the ending was just silly and implausible, mind you most of the film was like that. like shape of water, roma and others the film seems to have hoodwinked critics and audiences alike into believing that this is some form of great social comment and insight. IT IS NOT whilst it is good that a film from Korea has won the plaudits this has, it is also very indicative of the times that everyone has read into the film, when really what they are seeing is just not there"
630,A Film to Die For!,rohanpunera,1 February 2020,10,"This film is extremely engaging and gripping. The way the film switches it's genre was marvelous. Direction, Story and Acting have been mastered. These films require their due recognition. Truly a masterpiece"
631,"It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the non-metaphorical world, the destination is uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way.",MrPupkin,3 February 2020,10,"It is always exciting to see what the Frenchies decided was film of the year as it never fails to be a better pic than whatever the Hollywood menagerie showers with a critical accolades come Springtime. Little did I expect Cannes Film Festival to award the prestigious Palme D'or this year to a director who has been one of my least favorite filmmakers...until now. Bong Joon-ho's English film debut, 2013's SNOWPIERCER, struck me as overrated and dumb while 2017's OKJA was cartoonish and ham-fisted. It didn't help that he'd relegated two of my favorite actors, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, to cringe-inducing career-low sideshow performers. Besides that, I just couldn't vibe with his grotesque and bumbling concoction of family-friendly cuteness, ultra violence, and quirky humor. It reeked of trying too hard and failed to land with me at every turn. With that said, let me be the first and most surprised person to say with no reservations PARASITE is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. However, there's the other genetically engineered super pig in the room: PARASITE has an awful lot in common with last year's Palme D'or winner SHOPLIFTERS. Putting aside that the former is a Korean production and the latter was Japanese, both films follow the lives of a poor family as they struggle on the fringes of society, running cons and scams to get by in a callous world. They are held together by their honest love for one another, and their example is set juxtaposed to the neglectfulness of a consumerist society that allows so many to fall through the cracks in the first place. But the main way that Joon-ho one-up's his award-winning predecessor is with an incisive sense of humor suffused in each character, a humor that is immediately, physically translatable despite the language barrier. It works here so well precisely because it's reigned in and understated throughout the film, making the more manic parts hit harder - such as when Park So-Dam apathetically lights a cigarette on a lidded toilet spewing flooded sewage out the sides. The class conscious themes that have pervaded Joon-ho's science fiction offerings up to this point are given a much greater sense of immediacy and relatability as we watch this struggling family elbow their way into the good graces of a rich, privileged, and naive family. Beside the obvious ""haves vs. have-nots"" one would expect from this scenario, there's clearly an exploration of the structures that relegate people into servitude and poverty for generations, not just by the wealthy elite but by the pervasive mechanisms of misfortune that are maintained by the working class as we claw at each other's throats for short-term gain. Believe the hype, PARASITE is well deserving of the praise it has received thus far. It's tense, hilarious, and poignant, and I'm forced to genuinely re-evaluate this director's output knowing that he knocked it out of the park this time."
632,CROSSING THE LINE,js-66130,2 February 2020,9,"Rooting for an impoverished but resourceful underdog struggling to make ends meet, sets up a standard feel good movie scenario. Seemingly innocuous, ""Parasite"" captures the lively trials of the Kim family as they scheme and trick their way into cushy employment, starting an invasion of sorts. The web of lies in an escalating con targeting the insensitive and gullible Park family opens a series of mouth watering doors, but alas, there's always some that should remain shut.Whether it's borders, classes, or smells, everyone has a line, that once crossed, destroys most semblance of rationale. ""Parasite"" brilliantly dissects how these boundaries (however personal and subjective) are developed within our very complicated and unique species.Filmed almost exclusively within the two families' domiciles, one a filthy, cramped basement apartment, the other a glorious, spacious and meticulously spotless mansion on the hill, ""Parasite"" offers an obvious and very deep class chasm as plot kindling.Delicious absurdist touches like peach fuzz allergies, hammer throw expertise, American Indian infatuations, and wifi signal hunting, are peppered throughout offering much welcomed distraction. Spinning an endearing class dichotomy comedy wildly out of control adds white knuckle power to the jarring second act. Sides are drawn early on, making it is easy to cheer for the bottom feeders in this warfare, but not everything on screen is black and white. The consequence of action and reaction during the increasingly muddied grey areas powers this film. What is good? What is evil? How is that line drawn?Sneaky, powerful, perfectly paced, funny, shocking, and quite wonderful. Can a film be both dark and bright? Yes, yes it can.hipCRANK"
633,An Original Work of Art,tyelder,7 February 2020,10,"Yesterday, at around the beginning of the third act, I 'came to' and realized that this film had hooked my complete attention; then, at the roll of the credits, I had so many thoughts that were provoked by nearly every shot of this movie-laughing and awe-struck by what I'd just experienced. It had been a long time since a movie had given this effect, and it's original films like this that come out of nowhere every once-in-awhile. And today, I know for sure I have to write down my thoughts about this new surprise hidden gem, Parasite, because it truly deserves to be called a masterpiece.
This is my first, and most definitely not my last, foreign film to make this list of the greatest. I'm so thrilled that I was motivated to go see this as it has pushed my boundaries of what I thought makes a movie great.
Bong Joon Ho has delivered a flawless comical satire that focuses on real issues of the divisions of social classes that are present in every society-so it is not just relatable to Koreans. The genres that can be attached to the movie are numerous since it has bits of comedy, drama, suspense and even thriller aspects that all perfectly interweave together to hold your focus until the very end. It is both moving and thought-provoking, but is also a movie I'd recommend to anyone at any age or stage in their life. It is an all-around masterful original piece of cinema which makes for a very fun time at the movies.
Adding to the greatness of the film is the performances from the entire cast. A great ensemble of talented actors-including Ho's long time collaborator Kang-ho Song-make watching every character on screen a moment not to miss. When there is so much chemistry within an on-screen family, you know that the acting is superb to a point at which you forget you are watching a fictional story. You just sympathize with each character because you understand how their actions are driven.
Intertextuality is big in this film and makes a second viewing necessary and welcomed. I could watch this movie over and over and find many more hidden aspects that further prove how much thought and time went into crafting it. Bong Joon Ho has my pick for directing and this film for best foreign, possibly best overall.
Inspiring to both film enthusiasts and to the everyday human being-this one is very monumental to foreign cinema since it leaves you having a different perspective on the industry. It warns us not to overlook nor disregard a movie simply because we don't like reading subtitles.

634,A masterpiece,skakistikaprovlimata,3 February 2020,10,We should keep it in a time capsule for the future generations. This describes a whole era.
635,No way I will not watch this.,ozakevin,2 February 2020,10,"Great, Masterpiece.
This movie pictures how human, rich or poor, can do anyhing at any cost to earn what they wanted. But exclusively, this movie shows that even poor people can fool or at this point, ""PARASITE"" onto you, rich or poor.
At first-half of the film, I could laugh. But at second-half ('til end), I get the moral lesson of the film."
636,NOT AN OSCAR MOVIE,affan_sidd,10 January 2021,6,"Comparing the nominees, this movie is surely not an Oscar wining movie. Ahhhh but Hollywood has something else in their mind.
Anyways, a good watch though, unique story about the class difference."
637,Fascinating,Maxence_G,3 February 2020,8,"I really enjoyed this film, because Bong Joon-Ho perfectly masters its original and impactful story of the underprivileged family who uses all the means at their disposal to rise in society although they are aware that there have no place. The best aspect of this film is that it takes no sides in the script. In addition, this film is wonderfully topical although it only briefly touches on subjects such as social networks, it does this very effectively by mixing Thriller and Comedy."
638,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",sanosito,18 January 2020,6,"Good: all the actors, most of the acting and directing, hearing the beauty of the spoken Korean language, the sets (in particular, the first floor and yard of the award winning Namgoong Hyeonja designed house), the cinematography and the first half of the film.
Bad: the second half of the film.
Ugly: the overflowing toilet.The first half of the movie was magical. The storyline and setup were unique, credible and crisp. Then, it all fell apart. The punchline was a low blow at best. Too many pratfalls, way too surreal, overly silly and sadly pretentious. As a member of the (target?) audience I felt cheated. It should have been so much more and could have been with very little tweaking and tightening. Bottom Line: Parasite does not deserve the Best Picture Award or the Best Director Award from the Academy, period."
639,Did we all watch the same movie?,rchosen-193-5535,10 February 2020,2,"So the movie won an oscar, was claimed to be a masterpiece and so on. Like most Oscar movies they are either really good or really bad. In this case the movie was highly overrated.Ignoring the fact nothing that is done in the movie is logical or would actually work in real life, the movie doesn't seem to know what kind of movie it is. If movies have a twist or something you didn't expect, usually you are like ""Oh wow, that was amazing!"". But this left me confused. Alot of what happens makes the movie feel pointless. Obviously this is a spoiler free review, so I'll just say some movies have good guys and bad guys, not sure if the movie makers understood what that means in this.The only reason I gave it two stars was it was South Koreas first movie to get an Oscar."
640,Really good movie,testonkar,10 February 2020,8,"Really good movie, well directed and played by actors, story is also Excellent, it's showing the reality of our society, and mental behavior of different people of different stage."
641,Truly thought-provoking and telling cinema,samuelmark-00575,3 February 2020,10,Not many movies combine entertainment and social commentary in equal measure but this one sure does. There are many layers to the plot; there's the events that you're watching but there's also a deeper layer that you're almost compelled to think about as you watch. Everyone will have a slightly different takeaway of what the filmmakers are trying to say but I think everyone will get something valuable from it. I would recommend 100 percent!
642,Fantastically Flawless,kager-69310,4 February 2020,10,"One of the best movies i've ever seen. This movie is full of wonderful surprises.
The scene where the sister sits on the toilet on her phone as it's overflowing was really striking and perfectly juxtaposed her true circumstances and the life she lived in Mr Parks house. Also the scene where the old housekeeper is attempting to push the shelves out of the way was striking and really unexpected whilst being satirical(laughed out loud). I have to say the house having a basement where her husband lived was the most shocked and surprised ive been in a while from a movie.It also works in a metaphorical sense to portray how although on the surface everything seems very normal in the house much like how the family seems to be regular people working for the Park family although they are deceiving them. The whole movie took me by surprise and I didn't see any of it coming; it's really clever. I laughed out loud many times sometimes feeling somewhat guilty for having done so. The director and everyone in the movie and involved deserve major praise for pulling it off. I also have to admit I was somewhat shocked that the son survived as it appeared he had bled out, i guess they were again playing on the idea of things not being as they seemed. It's a great movie in the sense that it explores deep subjects such as inequality, meritocracy, social class heirarchy ignorance but what makes it great is that you don't have to notice or connect to any of those themes what so ever to truly enjoy the movie, this movie is for everyone.
Satirical, metaphorical, genius, paradoxical, impulsive, genuine; watch this movie!!!!"
643,A master piece,jmerienne,4 February 2020,10,"Like watching a Sergio Leone, this director is just a god in film making."
644,One of the years best,johnnygs,11 February 2020,9,Glad that I watched this movie before the Oscar nominees were announced. I feel a number of people Judge it harshly bcos it won a film over other equally excellent moviesIn my opinion it's definitely one of the best movies of 2019-2020.Excellent performances and a harsh view of people at the bottomThe movie switches very quickly from comedy to drama to violence near end.Sad open ended finale.Highly recommend
645,What a movie!!!,sriramthestranger,9 February 2020,8,"The plot starts as a comedy by taking advantage of a gullible rich lady and slowly creeps into the harsh truth of haves and have not. The climax leaves a strange impact on - ""Is it even possible to attain the status of a good earning life style for such a family in honest ways?"". One of the masterpiece from Korean films. A worthy watch that keeps you entertained!!"
646,"Solid overall, but some flaws that make it less than amazing",MandAandM,4 January 2020,7,"The entire basement characters arc felt almost dissatisfying just existing. This includes everything from the tacked on morse code shenanigans, to the being held hostage by a damn camera phone. I really would love to watch a version of this movie's plot where the basement just doesn't exist, and focus on the 2 primary families intriguing plot line."
647,A flawless masterpiece.,joshbarton15,4 February 2020,10,"Bong Joon-ho is a South Korean filmmaker with a very diverse filmography and one who brings a distinct reputation with him when releasing a film, the Bong Hive being the name of his devoted fanbase. His latest film, Parasite, gets a long awaited release in the UK and going into this one blind is one of the best decisions you could ever make.All unemployed, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident.Parasite is an absolute triumph from Bong Joon-ho, his film building and building to a crescendo that I didn't see coming at all. It's a brilliantly written film, the humour running through the social commentary of class separation often genius throughout and the dark humour that takes things to the next level utterly breathtaking. There's a real intricacy to the screenplay, co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won, taking time to introduce us to the characters in such a way it makes what unfolds even more hard-hitting.It isn't just the screenplay that deserves special mention for its intricacy, the production design on Parasite providing a stunning backdrop for the narrative to unfold. The time and effort that goes into making something as wonderful as the Park's family home always amazes me and it pays off majorly with its maze-like features almost serving as a character itself. Hong Kyung-pyo's sweeping cinematography through the narrow corridors and lower-class neighbourhood where the Kims actually live is beautifully neat and Yang Jin-mo's score accompanies the film with a wonderfully symphonic prowess.Coming to the performances, Parasite is full of great performances from a cast who have been nothing but infectious this awards season. It's very much an ensemble piece, each of them getting their moment to showcase their talents but the stand-outs for me were Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Cho Yeo-jeong.Parasite is Bong Joon-ho's magnum opus and has set an incredibly high bar for the rest of 2020 in film to live up to. I haven't been as fully engrossed in a film as I was watching this masterpiece unfold and I can only imagine it's going to get better with each viewing."
648,Pretty Good Foreign Crime-Drama!,gwnightscream,17 November 2019,6,"This 2019 crime-drama tells of a needy, Asian family that sneaks their way into a wealthy businessman's home by pretending to be hired help and after one of their children tutors his daughter. Things go well at first, but take a drastic turn effecting everyone involved. This is a pretty good film with a bit of humorous, tense and dramatic moments. Give this one a try if you enjoy Foreign or crime
films."
649,Overrated,bdbj77,19 July 2020,2,"Why this won best picture I will never know. The translation was horrible. Plot filled with holes, and so so acting."
650,Mind blowing,nevenahers,6 February 2020,10,"A true masterpiece, 10/10! I don't think I will get to watch a better movie soon!"
651,Just saw it for the second time.,soulexpress,3 February 2020,10,"PARASITE impressed me enough that I wanted to see it again. Having done so, I've increased my initial 9 rating to a full 10.What I thought were plot holes turned out to have simple explanations that I had missed in my initial viewing. And with the element of surprise gone, I could more fully concentrate on the characters and their motives. I especially liked that no one here is 100% blameless or 100% evil. That kind of moral ambiguity is common in everyday life. I only wish it were more common in movies.This time, I also paid much closer attention to the film's abundant symbolism. Admittedly, though, I still couldn't figure out the significance of the Scholar's Rock. But that says more about me than it does about this magnificently brilliant film.If not the for THE IRISHMAN, I would root for PARASITE as this year's Best Picture winner. Still, it's a shoo-in for Best Foreign Language Film."
652,"Fascinating mix of dark comedy, drama and thriller",teoteddy,2 February 2020,10,"It's been a while since I watched a movie that made such impact on me. First of all, I really liked the story of different social classes, despair, greed, deception, pride and prejudices. It is masterfully directed by Bong, carefully navigating through a scenario full of twists and unexpected turns. Dialogues are funny and there is good characterization making characters complexed and intriguing. Parasite can't be categorized in a specific movie genre, rather it's a mix of dark comedy, drama and thriller which is it's strong feature because there are not so many movies who can balance so well between those genres. This is movie that I will gladly watch many times. A real gem of Korean cinematography."
653,Parasite - an unconventional storytelling,sanglap1,8 February 2020,10,"What is Parasite - A Satire? Sarcasm, humor, emotion, human condition, suspense, thriller, social issues, drama, thought provoking dialogues, strong and smooth acting - all ingredients cooked with utmost perfection and balance and served with elegance and style.It is an unconventional storytelling, it may look very simple and everyone might watch and love this film but it has layers of strong and complex structure and an extraordinary artistic flavor. The beauty of cinema lies in its frame, because that's the window through which we watch and experience the story. And that's where comes the cinematography and the production design, it has a rich and subtle tone with detail level precision , every frame, every shot is unforgettable. Another unconventional part of this movie is it's background score, we hear operatic music during a slow motion chaos. May be the background score is inspired from Hitchcock movies.This film and the characters do not leave you after you finish watching, it stays with you, even if you want you can't escape from them, then slowly you learn to live with them in your head, because you are also one of them. It is a hypnotic movie which is disturbing but you will still want to watch it again and again, probably because you want to laugh, cry and get scared - all at the same time.Parasite touches so many corners of human emotions without trying too hard to over amplify any scene or sequence. Kudos to Director Bong Joon-ho for his visionary approach to tell a story which is not unknown to anyone, forcing us to believe that we are very much part of this cruel world."
654,Tension between upperclass elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face.,eelen-seth,30 June 2019,10,"After winning the Palme d'Or in Cannes, the French Oscars let's say, Sydney Film Festival was quick to reel in that line and get Parasite to screen at multiple sold out venues around the city. At the end of the festival, the film got awarded the biggest price (Best Film) and distributor Madman Entertainment decided to ride that wave of interest in the film, releasing this Korean dark comedic masterpiece just a week later in Australian cinemas.Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sick) is a young man with not much to look forward to. He basically lives in a basement apartment with his scruffy dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), snappy mother Chung-sook (Hyae Jin Chang) and his clever sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam). Their tiny confined home feels too small to live in with four adults. They use free wi-fi from their neighbours and try to make some easy money by folding boxes for a pizza delivery company, until Ki-woo's friend offers him to take over a student to tutor.Faking a university diploma and a shameless backstory, Ki-woo introduces himself to a rich family in a dream house with the most well maintained lawn you've ever seen. Here he becomes the tutor to Da-hye (Ziso Jung), daughter of wealthy CEO Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and his emotionally unstable wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong). Everything seems to go just as planned, until the almost perfectly executed plan starts to unravel more and more out of control.Scriptwriters Bong Joon-ho (who also directed) and Han Jin-won have so many twists up their sleeves to make this the most entertaining and well-written film you'll see this year. Every line gets delivered so smoothly, as if it seems like these characters are real people who are living through this story, with Jung Jae-il's classical score, masterfully playing in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo differentiates itself from a more realistic gritty style in the basement apartment, to a more dreamlike perfectly slick style when focusing on our wealthy characters. This point of view makes us look at these two very contrasting groups of people in a different way, to make it even clearer that they don't belong in the same world. Class systems have never looked more down to earth yet perfect before.Though Bong wants you to feel for both parties, the lines will blur at certain points and make your sympathy for anyone bounce back and forth with feverish consequences. Everyone has a sense of selfishness to them when it comes to goals, but being nice doesn't take that much effort. The film focuses on poverty, desperation and what we are willing to do to take what should be ours. Tension between upperclass elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face. Bong (Okja) always loves to blur the lines of genre and he makes sure he hits every step on the staircase, to succeed in his efforts.Parasite is a mite that doesn't discriminate and will get under every moviegoer's skin, no matter what background you come from. The power of this story, is found in the way comedy and drama rub each other in just the right way to spark a bit of thriller, that flips over into pure horror when despair and hate meet each other. This is one infestation you can't get rid off."
655,Harrowing story of the crimes that greed and envy lead to,Humphreywashere,9 February 2020,8,"The movie 'parasite' was harrowing. Greed and envy - thats what it is about. Lying, cheating family traits, inflicting these lies on a kind family who employs them. First the son - lies about his tutoring qualifications and he cheats his way into manipulating the underage daughter he is tutoring. Through further subterfuge, his sister, father and mother all end up working for the family. Unbeknownst to them, the family of lying 'good for nothings' have not only ruined the income prospects of former employees, they go stir crazy and it leads to double murder and countless horrible outcomes not shown.Were they punished enough for the horrible things they did to that kind family who employed them? I believe the filmmaker tried to partly justify their actions based on the inequality of the social divide between one family to the next. If enterprise and cunning got this family into employment, why were these skills not used for employment from lawful means?
The story is skillfully told but it is still a horrible story. There was little justice in the end, so it does make you regret watching it."
656,Hopes and Dreams of a Separated Korea,bugwyrus,10 February 2020,7,"I saw this Movie just one day after it won 4 Oscars:
Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature Film.
For me it deserves the Oscar for Best International Movie and best Original Screenplay but the best movie of the Year?? CMON...
This is the most overated movie of the Decade, it is a good movie sure, with a good Critic to society...
Showing the struggle of the classes, the Decay of the Rich who lives their plastic lives, and the Poor that must fight back and rise against opression and Tirany.
The problem with the movie, is that it drags in the first 30 minutes, the screentime should be cut to 1h30, 2 hours and 10 minutes is too long...
The Dark Humour presented here is really good, and the Climax of the movie, starting with the Flood is also Great. But some of the dialogues in the movie are lacking.
The directors work here is really good no doubt, but this movie is after all a Independant Movie with a short budget, with few sets, and some good Twists and Turns in the story...
The actors, like almost every Korean movie i've seen, seem authentic and act like real people so they do a very good job.
This Movie is a Good One, almost an 8 but the ending could have been better.
It is far from a masterpiece, so my review score is a 7 out of 10.
P.S: Loved the Critic to Kim Jong Un Regime, the Menace of the Power of a Button is as Powerfull as a Atomic Bomb LOL"
657,Great story! Beautiful film,tintuvjoe,11 February 2020,9,"Great story! Beautiful film
Great acting.Make sure to plan just don't go with the flow.father waits...but not sure how long.Watch it on 4K, Oled."
658,Bit of a Stinker Unfortunately,pglove,12 December 2019,6,"10/10 for acting, cinematography, and plot development1/10 for the second halfThis had the potential to resolve itself epically but instead quickly descended into a messy free fall of nonsense.There are so many intensely gripping Korean films I was sure this would be one of them. And for the first half I was engrossed. But the second half was a huge let down.The acting and production quality are fantastic but the resolution sucks. No spoilers.Watch the original Old Boy again, or The Chaser instead. This film has nothing but disappointment at the end.Boring."
659,Evil and shameless,wywilliamlu,3 April 2020,5,"What does this movie want to tell us?
That the people living at the bottom have a tough life?
That these people are evil and shameless?
That they are continue to be like this as if THEY are the heroes?
I can't believe this movie won 4 Oscars!"
660,A brilliant movie!,Robertt1997,10 February 2020,8,"If you want to see why this move took the Oscars, you should check it and give it a try. Maybe you would like or not. Just watch it!Yes, the metacritic score it's really high for this movie. But yeah, it's a ""must see"" movie. The soundtrack used in this movie is fantastic!The acting was great, from my point of view.If want to see a drama movie with a little few scenes of comedy, a ""dark comedy"" you should try it. Trust me, you won't lose anything."
661,Clever movie that will have you on the edge of your seat!,jnette-96678,31 January 2020,8,Great movie with likable characters. There were a lot of surprises. I was really rooting for them to succeed and couldn't believe how some things turned out. I was somewhat disappointed how it took a turn for the worse in the movie. Definitely shocking.
662,If thrillers were poignant and funny,witster18,5 February 2020,9,"Only mild spoilers.If you are looking for film that skillfully evokes a myriad of emotions from the audience - you've landed-on it! The Koreans have always been great at combining tones/genre's. Parasite Is a deftly handled film about social classes, income disparity(in particular, the psychological impact of it) and karma.Song Kang-Ho gives the standout performance as the father of a poor family who seems perfectly willing to break through any ethical walls to climb their way out of the slums.The meat of the storyline comes when the fathers' son infiltrates a wealthy household as an English tutor. Does the event spark an opportunity for financial freedom or horror for the entire family?This is both a visually and intelligently spectacular vision, played out to near perfection. There is some great symbolism throughout the film - the highs of high society, and the drowning abyss of the lower class. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking.The film is also as funny as it is thrilling. Hopefully American audiences can take all of the comedy-in as some can literally be lost in translation and dryness.The films' not perfect. I think the poor fathers emotional state could have been fortified a bit with a longer opening set-up; if for no other reason but to drive home the income disparity impact in Korea. Americans may not fully understand the dangers of income disparity and the ""monopolization and manipulation of capitalism(a good system but not necessarily a foolproof one), but perhaps watching this will help. That aspect of the ending is a slightly under-developed, or just perhaps under-appreciated according to your demographic, though the ending as a whole is still well-fashioned and thought-provoking.I've only seen a few of the Best Picture nominees(Fordv8, 19178, Once Upon a Time7.5-8, and Irishman7) , but this is clearly my personal favorite. It wont win. IMO, The Oscars gifted ""The Artist"" the ""foreign acknowledgement Best Picture"" a few years back, so it may be awhile before we see another one. Not that there haven't been many that should have one or at least been nominated. On direction, writing, acting, cinematography, and pure enjoyment - this film checks every box for me.You might like this if you liked: The Host(7), 3-Iron(7.5-8), Nightcrawler(8), Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance(8)"
663,Speechless,chrisw-17947,11 February 2020,10,"I've been hearing great things about this and after it won 4 Oscars including Best Picture I just had to see for myself even though I wasn't 100% sure what it was about. After only 15 minutes of watching I fell in love with this movie. And it got every award it deserved. Parasite has so many genres in this movie but I would have to say this is darkly written in the most creative way possible. It's funny, dramatic, and intense. I can't even think of anything that I didn't like about this movie because I seriously enjoyed every minute of it. 10/10"
664,"Wow, just WOW!",pegah_92,13 February 2020,10,"NEVER seen a movie like this. Wow what a masterpiece! Twist after twist, it had it ALL!!!"
665,Masterpiece..,adi-patil1993,12 February 2020,10,The Korean drama and thriller written & directed by Bong Jong Ho is truly a masterpiece. It is entruguing thriller. And every bit of the screenplay keeps you in the movie till the end... Outstanding work of modern art
666,"Let me in now, let me in now, Bill Gates, Donald Trump, let me in now.",bombersflyup,21 November 2019,7,"Parasite is unique and manically engaging with humour, it doesn't all work though.Another reviewer captured it right, in saying it's lacking of human spirit. Unlike that person I like the film, but I do agree with that. Yeo-jeong Jo's good as the house wife, but the Kim Ki-Jung character's ineffective and her mother unlikable. I don't buy that Kim Ki-taek and Kim Chung-sook could actually fill these job roles at this time, more so the mother. Plus the guy living in the basement and the Morse code, quite stupid and the resolution well it's weak. It's obvious the father will be in the basement, after fleeing the incident and Kim Ki-woo just isn't going to go from the slums to earning enough money to buy this place."
667,"The idea of ""Parasite""",jad-52260,12 December 2019,10,"Parasite is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in a while, it has a message that you have to look in another perspectives to look in a different ways from the poor families and the rich family, and that doesn't mean they are rich they don't look after for the poor families, but the greediness and the hatred between the two poor families, show us how is the innocent family is.""Spoiler ""
The greedy between two Poor families that caused climax of Antagonism. The poor families because of the greediness and hatred the ""rich family"" and Innocent family has suffered, and caused a death to the rich family."
668,an alright watch,agof,21 November 2023,6,"It's a ""lyrical comedy"" film (which means it's not funny, but you are not supposed to cry over the misfortunes either) with a dramatic story. To put it simply it's a ""slice of scam"" movie.It's a bit weird in looking ""more"" than its subject matter, but it's not pretentious. All the film-students-never-film-workers and the so-called ""movie"" ""critics"" tried their hardest to make you think this is some indie art-house mumblecore drama about gay-cowboys eating pudding, and oscars are always a ""black spot"" for the movies, but in the end this is an alright watch. And it will leave you with nothing, just like all the average films."
669,The critics and award shows are wrong.,philrhodes13,11 January 2020,1,"This movie is rotten garbage. Main characters are unlikeable. The story as it plays out, predictably, is tedious. The characters lives are not interesting to watch. 36 minutes in I wondered if something interesting was going to happen. The movie is not funny and for sure not a thriller. The ending was ridiculous. I wasted my time watching this."
670,A symbolic clash of classes,minister_of_silly_walks,11 October 2019,10,"An intricate depiction of the society classes forming in every modern society around the world. Rightfully asking the question: ""Who is living of whom?"" It is filled to the brim with metaphors examining the cultural clashes between two very different families from vastly different social standings, headlined by a very strong script and fleshed out characters. Furthermore, it has amazing cinematography with some creative editing choices, great sets and the shot selections are flawless."

And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i thing that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion.""Gisaengchung"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with ""Joker"" which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. Its a universal theme.And this movie is a universal treasure."
672,"Best movie of the decade,century, maybe all time",alansabljakovic-39044,24 January 2020,10,After 6th watch I think I got all little details and all messages. I really love the climate change/rain message. He changes genres so smoothly and never bored me once on my 3rd watch in last week and a half. I just gotta say Bravo Bong!!!
673,It's not a movie problem if you don't know how to read,laurapiacentinicasarin,12 February 2020,10,"Awesome movie, could appreciate every minute of it only because I learned how to read when I was a little child. Fair Oscar winner."

675,Myth of meritocracy under a looking glass,slikts,11 February 2020,8,"The responses this film draws are often a study of internalized propaganda; specifically, the smoke screen of meritocracy that attempts to cover the systemic injustices of the world. The common thread is to object to the impoverished characters as being portrayed as too capable; the ""If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"" saying being an epitome of this mindset. It's a saying that you could hear in a schoolyard, because it betrays a childish level of understanding, or lack thereof: not considering unearned wealth transfer; not considering the disparity of opportunities; and not considering that the wealth gap is particularly large in South Korea.It's unclear how many people who are willingly ignorant about injustice can be reached at all, but art like this film must help, at the very least by sustaining a discussion of the topic of injustice and inequality."
676,Not worth the hype,elabat,30 January 2024,7,"OK so after years i finally succeed to convince my wife to watch this film with me for the first time both.I had heard all the hype, the Palme d'or, tje oscar etc.. that i was conviction this movie was going to be exceptionnal.During the first hour i had that feeling that everything i thought was going to happen, happened. I was skeptical because i thought something special, subtle, inexepected, original. But not at all. Everything expected happen. The boy hired, the girl hired, the father, the mother. Not even with some big originality.Suddenly i must say the basement thing. OK we're going somewhere different but for what ? Even this idea is not really going deeper.Some tallk about class fighting. Rich vs poor ? Really this thing so.. already seen. With a family of poor people almost sociopath ? We dont root for them, as we dont root for the rich either (questionnable..).The only thing i like was the last scene. The boy responding to his father that he will become rich and buy the house. And as all plans do go well we can think that it will never happen and the father will surely die in the basement. And with (good?) reason.Bref. All that for that. Not worth an Oscar for a long shot. Hollywood and cinema world love themselves too much to make us believe what they think is great is. Let's not be fooled."
677,The Privilege Class crashes into the Working poor,tm-sheehan,3 February 2020,9,"My Review- Parasite
My Rating 9/10I'm so glad I got to finally see Parasite today on the day it won 2 well deserved BAFTA British Academy Awards Best Movie not in The English Language and Best Original Screenplay for its writer/ director Bong Joon Ho.Parasite has already received numerous accolades, with six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best International Feature Film, making it the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award recognition. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film won the award for Best Foreign Language Film. It received four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards. It also became the first non-English film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.The film's title ""Parasite"" was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, which he had to convince the film's marketing group to use. Bong said ""Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites.""I read Director and script writer Bong Joon
is a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock and I'm sure Hitch would praise this movie even the music score is reminiscent of Hitchcock films . The film makes several nods to Alfred Hitchcock throughout. Stairs are used as a motif, voyeurism is used as characters watch scenes through windows 14 times, and (most obviously) there is a brief glimpse of an out of place Alfred Hitchcock collection in the Park's home.
I thought it also reminded me of Quentin Tarantino in its dark comedy and there are some very funny moments especially in the first half of this unique and original film.Unfortunately I've only seen Parasite on DVD but I hope to see it again on a Cinema Screen soon.
It's a movie I want to watch again as it's as good as all the hype it's getting and what a journey! it takes the audience on.
Described as a Black Comedy Thriller as of 2/2/20 this film had grossed a Worldwide $163.3 million and was estimated to have cost $11 million to produce.Of course I don't know any of the actors but they're all terrific in their roles and as an ensemble cast one of the best this year .
I still think it's odd to include this film in 2 Best Film Categories at next weeks Academy Awards it had no chance of winning Best Picture but I'm certain it will win Best International Feature Film and it probably deserves to. I'm still so fond of Pedro Almodóvar's Pain & Glory..Ps an add on comment after seeing Parasite on a Cinema screen the best way to appreciate a film like this.After seeing Parasite on a Cinema Screen at last I appreciate the movie even more.
There's so much to absorb and think about in the layers of Pasasite. The story depicts Class divides, Climate Catastrophes, Nuclear War fear and Violence due to mental illness and resentment.
I was wrong in my first review to think Parasite had no chance of Winning Best Film of the year and I still think it's unfair that films in a Foreign Language have 2 bites of the Best Film cherry but this movie is a great film .This is not a new review my original will do but just an observation after seeing ""Emma"" this week which portrayed Upper Class 19th Century snobbery and class division then the excellent HBO series ""Succession ""portraying an incredibly wealthy Media magnates family living a life of incredible privilege financed by greed and cunning plotting the next coup.
The common thread that Parasite, Emma and Succession have is total separation from the feelings and aspirations of anyone outside their Class it's survival at all costs and disregard anyone who smells differently speaks differently, dresses differently or anyone doesn't process a degree or wealth.
The poor family's ingenious scheme to obtain a better life regardless of the outcome shows more intelligence and hope to improve their situation than the insular, neurotic self obsessed rich Park family.2 comments from Parasite said by Ki-taek and wife Chung-sook stay in my mind .Ki-taek: They are rich but still nice.
Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: They are nice because they are rich.Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: If I had all this I would be kinder.Ki-taek: Rich people are naive. No resentments. No creases on them.
Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron. Those creases all get smoothed out by money.Both families end up with creases and resentments in Parasite so I guess both families fit the definition of Parasites-parasiteLearn to pronounce

678,Interesting film which leave a lasting impression,knhu,19 October 2019,7,"I rate the film for its intention, for its rawness, and for the impression it leaves after I walk out of the cinema.
Nevertheless, I don't feel convinced by the acting, nor the somewhat implausible story line.
I can watch this film as a well-packaged piece of entertainment. But I don't think I'd be missing much, if I hadn't watched it."
679,"Overrated, non-logical events",q-48389,12 January 2020,1,"I really do not know how is it rated over 8. Too many plot holes, too much drama and lack of build-up make this film very hard to watch. Is it rated that high because the majority of voters are Korean? A waste of time."
680,Great and different,sbweightman,25 January 2020,8,"A great film that really has a bit of everything in it. It starts off funny as they infiltrate the household before turning into a thoughtful look at the gap between the richest and poorest in society, and ultimately ends up as a bloodbath and rather sad. The social commentary is topical, the plot has some good surprises along the way, and the arty style and use of music makes it a very interesting film to watch."
681,He is desrve the Oscar,ahmed_omar_2010,11 February 2020,10,Best movie in 2019 really it fantastic I really enjoyed and loved a actors and I feeled I was lived with them that is the first Korea move I ever watch
682,Amazing. A true masterpiece.,ragmmv,11 February 2020,10,"I thought that this was definetly one generic movie (everything nice-something happens- that situation is solved) but it was not. I was amazed by the expression that the director has put on this film. Very nice original story and graphism.
I would recommend everyone to watch this.
This movie truly deserved the oscar."
683,A unique and unpredictable feature film from one of the world's most exciting directors,eddie_baggins,3 February 2020,9,"Over the course of well-regarded and unique films such as The Host, the under-appreciated Snowpiercer and the crazy Netflix distributed Okja, Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho has established himself as one of the most noteworthy foreign directors of the last few decades.Following on with his ability to mix and match genres with an ever-present dark vein of humor seeping through his narratives veins, Ho has hit it big with the surprise 2019 hit Parasite, that now sits pretty in the IMDB Top 50 films of all-time and stands head and shoulders above other foreign films from 2019 in regards to box-office takings off a small scale budget of a couple of million dollars.Incomparable to any other film you could think of, Parasite is a very original beast, that believe it or not combines drama, comedy, thriller and even moments of horror to ensure that its many twists and turns and social commentary co-inhabit to create an entirely unpredictable experience that is best watched with as little pre-understanding as possible.Centered around the below the poverty line Kim family and their new employment in the household of the wealthy Park family, Parasite allows Ho to weave together a loaded plot-line that may seemingly be headed one way, only to surprise us all as it veers further and further away from the expected.Wonderfully played out by its core cast, with highlights from Kang-ho Song as father Ki-taek and Hye-jin Jang as mother Chung-sook, Parasite is the type of unnerving film that keeps you mentally on edge throughout as you're glued to the screen, unable to turn away from a disaster in the making that must surely be headed towards a finale as wild as we would expect from a director like Ho.As you watch the expertly directed, edited and scored film, one that has you laughing one minute and gasping for air the next, you begin to appreciate that you're watching a director operating at the top of their game, in what's still likely a career only around its halfway mark, it's exciting to think of where Ho and his inventive mind can go in the future as he continues to give us films that seem to be cut entirely from their own cloths.In an age where many films are nothing but pale imitations, remakes or sequels, its exciting to see efforts such as Parasite that give us something new, fresh and exhilarating, no doubt a reason why the word of mouth from cinema-goers helped make Parasite a world-wide smash hit and a genuine Best Picture contender at the upcoming Oscars.Final Say -While not flawless, Parasite isn't far off it, a darkly observed social commentary piece that is both heartbreaking and brilliantly humorous, Bong Joon Ho has further established himself as one of the in-form directors working today with what could well be his most important film yet.4 1/2 peaches out of 5"
684,One of the best film's I have seen in my life.,squirtlepenis,10 February 2020,10,"Full Star ratings would seem off had this movie not been such a well written roller coaster of events, this movie has moments that are as thrilling and terrifying as S. Kings Misery. This movie is realistic and immersive, simply a must watch film, with lots of hard work and time put into it, unforgettable."
685,THIS. IS. SO. METAPHORICAL.,thegldt,28 September 2019,10,"'Parasite', this year's winner of the Cannes Film Festival's highest award, the Palme d'Or, is so many things - tiptoeing different genres, exploring themes of family, work, inequality, and the class divide - rolled into one thoroughly wild, exciting, hilarious, dark, tragic, and unpredictable film.Honestly, I can only sum it up in the wise words spoken by one of the characters: THIS. IS. SO. METAPHORICAL."

687,Loved it!,MovieLover1925,11 February 2020,9,Course after all the fuss about this winning best picture I had to see what it was all about! Surprisingly funny and depressing all in one go..... the end really got dark... loved it.
688,Overrated,Dannov747,12 February 2022,6,"Parasite reminds me of those novels you sometimes read in English class or a literature club (ala Ulysses) and you had to appreciate all the intricacies, themes, and symbolism or risk looking uncultured. But those novels missed something really important, that gets lost in all the circlejerking about the symbolism and little details - whether or not its actually interesting to read. Whether it provides a good story, good dialogue, good characters.Similarly, Parasite is a movie rich in themes and symbolism. What I particularly liked is the mature exploration of class dynamics. Its the obvious central theme of the film and its done very well. I dont think anything in Hollywood could ever manage to explore this theme with such nuance and maturity.This movie is also a really good work of art. The direction is top quality, and it effortlessly goes from comedy, to family drama, to horror, to thriller, and then finally ends in a Tarantino-esque finale.But the actual plot of the film? The dialogues, the drama, its all mediocre at best. What really happens in this film. What makes a viewer curious, interested, surprised? How do the characters develop, how does the plot develop, where and when is there interesting dialogue that pulls you in?In my opinion, the overarching script of this movie is not particularly strong when you evaluate it in terms of core storytelling. And worse, it doesn't use its runtime well in order to tell whatever it wants to tell. And while a film critic might be impressed by its symbolism and the way it shifts in tone and genres, I think it actually detracts from the viewer experience if the primary aim of the viewer is to see an enjoyable movie.I'm far from someone who merely enjoys popcorn fiction. There's a reason I hate Marvel movies. But I also think that a movie has to strike a balance, I don't think Parasite did that. I think it has benefited from collective overhyping that is partially a result of the heaps of praise by critics and partially because it is a decent movie released in a time of popcorn movie trash."
689,A Textbook Film Of Pretentiousness,CherryBlossomSamurai,21 November 2019,2,"The opposite of a singer who sings with soul is a singer who sings *as if* they have soul. This movie was done *as if* it were a satire, *as if* it were making a statement, *as if* it has a deeper meaning. Instead, it's hollow at its core, mean-spirited, and pointless. It's a film for those like the idea of making a point but not having to suffer any uncomfortable truths.The only good effect of this film is that it exposes the vacuity of those who praise it and their self-delusion. It's a barometer of the public's appetite for garbage. See this film only in the context of a sociology experiment and be shocked at how far we've fallen in our gullibility and how desperate we are not to face ourselves."
690,It's clearly a 10/10,eliasrau,5 November 2019,9,"Masterpiece, no cgi, no Michael Bay, extraordinary story, social critical.

694,Best film I've ever seen,elephantus-13015,26 January 2020,10,"Had a free screening at our campus. What I like is that it could have been mean spirited at any point, but it seems to have compassion for every party involved, no matter their transgression you understand and sympathize with them. This is way different than current day films, such as Knives Out or the other nominees where the social critique involves mockery and derision of the 'villains'. I wonder if it's the difference between hollywood white privilege vs korean cinema coming from an entirely different position of the socio economic hierarchy."
695,Wow,calebmschultz,18 January 2020,10,For sure the best movie I've seen of 2019. Nothing holds a candle to it.

697,Awesome film,upular,10 February 2020,9,"Less subtle but much more embodied depiction of social class at where each class lives. A Twist in the second half of film. Dark, funny, thrilling, and thought provoking. This film has all combinations."
698,"Fairly entertaining film, but one of 2019's best it is not",Horst_In_Translation,6 January 2020,6,"Okay, so these slightly over two hours are ""Parasite"" or ""Gisaengchung"", the original title that probably nobody in Europe or the United States is really aware of. This is one of the biggest players this awards season, also in North America, and that I find really surprising. It certainly also has to do with this movie winning the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes earlier this year. I guess it helps that director Bong Joon-ho has worked on films with big players from Hollywood too in the past. So it is a bit of back to the roots for him now. Anyway, people have said it is a powerful statement on inequality in society and while this is a key subject in the film, I don't think it elaborates on this in a really profound or groundbreaking way or is just super creative in its explanations. It is decent, maybe good, nothing more. This is the story of a really poor family, unemployed without any real prospect that through lucky coincidence (the son's friend) manages to sneak in at a rich family's house and eventually they all have jobs there with the help of fake exam reports and the people who actually live there have no idea they are all related.You can argue to what extent it is despicable what they are doing because obviously how they remove the limo driver and the maid is really full of intrigue. Still, sometimes I struggled with how realistic it all felt. I mean that it did not. For example that the driver really gets fired or that when hiring the mother as the new maid that the rich husband and wife do not talk about who made the suggestion. And there are more moments like this. It does feel kinda fictitious at times for me, which is a bit of a negative dealbreaker for sure because like I said you can see that this film tried to make a powerful statement. It also sometimes felt too much as if they were taking the idea of a parasite and what it does as too defining like how it kills the host eventually, which is what one man does to the other near the film's end and that really did not feel realistic at all to me. Just showy and for the sake of it because even in his letter he said that he felt sorry for the man and respected him, so if he should have attacked anybody, then I'd say it should have been the guy who lived down there and went rogue before that on everybody, especially the protagonist's family. And also that the son really with all the blood literally pouring out of his head survived the attack as we find out did not feel too likely to me. It was interesting though that it was this big rock he was attacked with that clearly meant something to him as he saved it when everything was under water before that and they had to leave their real home. Karma maybe a bit because they say this big mansion is their new home.Still there are funny moments too. After all this film calls itself a satire. The highlight comedically for me was when they are all under the bed and this scene easily could have gone wrong, but it was hilarious, especially when all except the dad get out, but then the rich family's son calls his parents and he is down there on the ground in the middle of the room, but they don't see him. Don't suspect anything. But before that it is not too respectful how they talk about the man's smell. So they are definitely on the shallow side when (they think) their employees are not nearby. The escalation started really from the moment they let the old housekeeper in the house again. I also wondered why they did. I mean I can see why they opened the door, but then they should have asked what she wants and brought it to her, which of course would not have been possible, but this would have been the approach that made sense in this scenario. Okay what else can I say about this film let me think. The three younger women were all really stunning. Somebody who says Asian women are not particularly attractive should see this film and maybe he will change his mind.I have read people compare this film to Pulp Fiction, but I would not agree with that at all. The ending is as bloody as anything Pulp Fiction has to offer, but this is hardly a criterion I'd say. It felt completely different to me and also slightly inferior at least. Key subjects like religion, absolution, betting, sexual abuse and drugs are not at the center of this film here and brief talk about drugs on one or two occasions does not change that. But kinda ironic that with this comparison the director of this film is going against Tarantino at the Oscars too, even if I am pretty sure BJH is not winning. I am not sure if I like the idea of Tarantino winning the big prize this year and maybe his first Oscar for his direction, but his film is definitely way superior compared to this one here. The other contender is Scorsese and while I think his film is not too bad, I am also not won over by that one as I was by Tarantino's. Scorsese's is roughly on par with Parasite.So to sum it all up, a few more words on Parasite: It has a really nice (almost) sex scene and in general the film was working best for the comedic moments for me. The only thrilling moment in terms of drama that had me on the edge of my seat was when the former maid was walking down this long path and we had no idea what was coming. Maybe people also liked this film so much because you never knew what would happen next and if for example the family was capable of killing the two rich guys (and their kids) in order to experience wealth for years to come. They are ruthless, but are they criminals? Up to you to decide and it is all subjective. Also interesting to see their confidence rise when early on they don't do anything against the guy almost peeing right into their home, but later on they are ready to attack him. So yes, it as an interesting movie that felt shorter than it actually was, but I still must say it was not a great watch and the awards attention is just too much, also for the cast, or basically for the one guy who gets all the acting praise here (the father I think). Still go see this one, just don't go in it with great expectations. I give it a thumbs-up and I am curious to see how it fares at the Golden Globes 2020 that are just about to start five minutes from now."

The tense string of relationships that hold all of the characters together... More thrilling than a thriller, more suspenseful than a suspense movie, More guessing than a murder mystery. It takes the typical human reaction to the next level. Just watch it without any prejudice. It will send your emotions on a journey that does not allow you to cheer for one character or the other. Entertaining as well as stab you in the stomach deeply with a moral sword to see how you feel. A masterpiece  with your morals as well as your feelings for justice."
701,Truly a masterpiece!,sofaga,23 December 2019,10,"You know a movie is good when there's been two months since you saw it and you're still thinking about it.

In this dramatic thriller with elements of dark comedy, an unemployed family schemes their way into working for a much wealthier family by posing as highly-qualified individuals.

Where to begin on how great of a film ""Parasite"" is? Never has there been a film of this genre to exceed so much and so perfectly. All the performances are incredible, the direction is Joon-ho's finest and most masterful and the story is beyond relevant to all of us. You never know where ""Parasite"" will lead you but when it gets there, it shocks you or it makes you laugh or even both. This film ranks among the best of the decade and definitely one of the best of the year. An absolute must-see."
703,Great Movie,RussHog,17 November 2019,10,I had no idea what to expect going into Parasite. Pleasantly surprised. It's about a low income family who deceives a wealthy family into hiring them - and soon the low income family weeds into the wealthy family's lives and begins to take complete control over them. But all is not what it seems - as the wealthy family's house harbors a dark secret. The script is excellent. You really care about all of the characters and you see this complex situation from every angle. One of the best movies this decade.
704,Finally getting some recognition,rezucchelli,10 February 2020,9,"Been some years now that I've been watching Korean Movies. Been trying my best to let friends know about how amazing some of them can be but with no luck, the language barrier and the different culture is enough to put off most from even trying. I'm glad I've sticked to it though. Old Boy was my introduction to korean movies, but Memories of Murder is what kept going back for more. Through MM I got to discover Kang Ho Song, who I personally think is an amazing actor, wont be exaggerating if I had him in my top 5, of which Al Pacino is #1. As for Parasite, dont need me to tell you that this is a gem of a movie that can't be missed, even if this is your first time venturing into korean cinema."

708,Incredibly thought provoking,kelley1231,11 February 2020,9,After watching the film I continued to run the film through my mind. The way the writers put subtle flashes to in your face current social climate issues was probably one of my favorite things about the film. Like other reviews I agree that it's almost two films in one. You will leave with internal questions and possibilities of different ending that could happen.
709,A tad underwhelming.,BA_Harrison,25 January 2020,7,"A down-on-their-luck, low-class family con their way into the employ of a rich household, but events turn sinister after they find a secret in the basement.Maybe I've just seen too many really messed up movies from the far East, but at the half-way point of Parasite, which sees the discovery of a hidden bunker and an unexpected inhabitant lurking within, I hoped that matters would get seriously twisted in the way that only Asian cinema can; but while things certainly get dark, the film is not nearly as edgy, or as bizarre, or as wild as the premise suggests.The initial plot twists and turns are deftly handled by director Bong Joon-ho, there are some superbly executed scenes of tension, the performances are great, the cinematography is lovely, and the film's social commentary on how different classes view and treat each other allows for plenty of delicious satire, but the second half of the film still feels frustratingly restrained in terms of sheer audacity. Restrained, and incredibly drawn out, Bong Joon-ho letting too many scenes drag their heels, with the ending taking an eternity to arrive.In short, definitely worth a watch, but a serious contender for best picture? Surely not."
710,"Decent for the first half, decends and fizzles from there",joeloss,9 February 2020,3,"The fact that there are such a ridiculous number of 10/10 reviews proves most of them are not genuine.

711,A brilliantly unique movie with endless unseen twists and turns,coombsstephen,24 January 2020,8,Its not often I go to see subtitled films but given the reviews I thought and I had to see this one and I am so glad I did.It's fantastically different and a great story that really draws you in but never stops surprising you with a laugh or shock around every corner.A great film and well worth anyone's time to go and see it.
712,CREATE a new word to describe the movie!,afnanrahmancr,9 December 2019,10,"It's just Fantastically Fabulous Masterpiece shown in the most creative way as possible..The content is so unique, never seen before..so creative, suspenseful ...Hats off to the makers, they're at the best of movie work!!
People need to watch this!!!!"
713,10/10,joelh-30167,24 December 2019,10,Simply Amazing. The movie has a little bit of everything. One of the best films I've seen.
714,Masterpiece between Rich and poor,janaelegant,21 December 2019,10,Parasite is good movie of the year. What a story plot and execution was so nice.
715,"The Social Commentary, It Showcases is Spectacular!",SoumikBanerjee1996,11 February 2020,10,"If a film makes you think continuously even after the show ends, it must be a great one! And this one did just that. Packed with terrific direction, commendable performances from the whole cast, the sheer excellence in story writing and screenplay alongside some beautifully crafted cinematography this film is surely a treat in every category. It made me think, it made me curious about the nuances and the small details and hints it got all over it. I just couldn't express the feelings I got watching this. In one word it's truly a masterpiece!It Won 4 academy awards this year, and that's not a mean feat! Making history at the oscars by winning the best film award as a foreign film for the first time ever. It alone portrays how much this film has been applauded by the critics, the industry people and us ; the audience. This is one of those rare movies where majority of us have the same opinion about. It's entertaining, thrilling, with some dark twists and some disturbing scenes as well that will surely make an impact in your mind. I assure you ; this movie will be in your head for a very long period of time!It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the 'Parasite' in here. The class difference, the economical boundaries set by the same people. It does symbolise with every aspect of the core issues that every major society in the world currently faces. One thing That I absolutely loved about it was the simplistic way it took to handle those sensitive subjects. And it can be applicable to any country though it's been made having Korean culture and society in mind ; this story, would be relatable to everyone. No matter the country Someone lives in.But you need to give your sincere focus and intellectuality while watching as it demands that. Every scene there has been crafted metaphorically. And those clever set ups can only be observed thoroughly if you are paying enough attention. Every character and their actions represent something. And you need to find that connection. And don't worry you will ; as the direction has been top notch throughout the entirety of the film. The character developments and The hidden metaphors are a treat to watch and experience.My own personal tip would be to avoid every promo, trailer and articles before watching it. Going with a blank slate will help you to digest every bit of it naturally.
Enough of the review now, I just wanna say, go and watch this film immediately. It's amazing and a surreal experience that could not be forgotten easily. Top of the table recommendation."
716,"One of the few films that can be granted the title of ""masterpiece"".",Pretentious_Viewer,20 December 2019,10,That's it. That's all I'm writing about this film. Now go watch it if you haven't already.
717,Questions,BandSAboutMovies,19 February 2020,6,"There's been some anger over this movie winning an Academy Award. It's hard for me to judge if a movie deserves to be considered the best film of the year, because the majority of movies that I love always end up being Italian end of the world movies or Mexican ripoffs of American horror tropes. Who am I to judge quality, I asked into the abyss, ignorant of the fact that I've created an entire site where I do exactly that.The idea for Parasite comes from Bong's own experience: he was a tutor for a wealthy family and imagined what it would be like to infiltrate their life. The title, which the director argued for, has a dual meaning. Sure, the poor servants are living off of the rich, but the masters are living off the labor class. They've lost the ability to clean and even move around for themselves. Everyone is a parasite in their own way.Instead of taking an existing home, the house was specially made for the film. That's because each character has a place that belongs to them and another place that is secret to them. Boon also spent considerable time storyboarding the entire film, as he believes that he must be ready for everything before the cameras start capturing footage.There's a phrase in South Korea called Hell Joseon. It means many things - unemployment, economic inequality, excessive work hours, the fact that poverty is inescapable for the lower class and that the system is rigged for the rich - but it generally means that life is hellish and hopeless.This is not a phrase that is unique to South Korea.What spoke most to me is that the history of the world - major battles and the plight of Native Americans - have been reduce to party table formations and the hobbies of disconnected children. The poor have been reduced to, at best, slave labor and at worst, ghosts. A ghost that appears to ruin the illusion that money and status seems to afford, but any man, no matter his station, can ruin and end the life of another.I've always realized that no matter how good or bad your life is, there are always people with a status above and below you. But I'll lean in and show you my hand. If there is any group that I'm prejudiced against, it's the rich. Yet it's hard to be for the family in this movie, as their machinations only prove that when they get the status they want - even for one fleeting night as they steal whiskey and a view of a yard that can never be theirs - they still hold down and destroy the lives a level beneath their own, only to then learn that their home has been flooded and taken away.There is no escape for any of the Kim family. The ways that they try to defeat the system through their attempts at grifting. But the system was built by people with far less scruples and morals. The home that promise luxury is also a prison, offering none of the comforts that Ki-taek dreams of, only a place to sneak out of at night and take his own life in his hands just to steal food.At the end of the film, I felt worry for each character and knew they were all doomed in their own way. They are all trapped, whether by death or hope or the house itself. No one gets a happy ending, even if we wished for one to come true. Is having hope in the midst of Hell Joseon worth it? I'd like to think so, even as this film doesn't.Is it the best film of the year? Is it worth the hype? Is it worth watching? I can't answer the first two questions, but definitely can say yes to the third. It takes time to get to the point when the staircase to the basement is revealed, but the movie had me from that moment.It did make me think, as all good movies should. Is everyone a parasite, unable to function alone in this world? Should a father's pride come in the way of his freedom? Should children be overindulged? How crazy is Morse code? These are the real questions I had."
718,"As Stakes Rapidly Rise, a Clever Family of Con Artists Slips Underwater",drqshadow-reviews,29 January 2020,9,"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family smoothly weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naive, white collar household.Unpredictably composed, Parasite effortlessly shifts between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in a deep breath, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, those inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."
719,A good film for Certain Audience; Not ME,carlos512,7 February 2020,6,"Parasite is without a doubt a well-thought good movie. It's clearly that it took lots of brains and talent to produce such a tape. It even has a message and on realities of society and a study on social classes in Korea. It addresses the issue of attitudes and the way we look at life, be it positive or negative, it has a huge impact. In addition, in general i love Asian Cinema, especially Chinese and Korean films. BUT saddly, this not for me.I did not like it. Did not enjoy it. Once I hit the 90 minute mark i was just about to give up. Still i stayed till the end because of the amazingly great reviews.Korean movies are just fantastic, and this might not be the exception. I have seen many online and in cinemas. they are AWESOME.Parasite to me was annoying, depressing, negative.... a total tale of betrayal... Parasite tries to teach that you must never open the doors of your house nor your trust to others... or at least be super careful..?? could be.You can watch the movie and make up your mind. You might be among the 99.99% of people who loves it. I am in the 0.01 % who do not :)(my humble opinion)"
720,Not so great,Jhonnydoe123,11 July 2020,5,"Movie was recommended by friend, who lauded it how many rewards it had gotten, so we watched this with high expectations. Despite the movie calling itself comedy there were only a few places in between that were relatively funny. And therein lies the problem, the movie was undecided which genre it wants to be, drama, comedy, horror, action? The story depends on plot twists to keep it going, some are predictable some are unexpected, and some are outright stupid. I'm talking about the finale, it just looks out of nowhere and forced so the viewers don't end up with a lackluster ending. It's a bizarre flick, but in no way great. I'd give it a slightly higher rating but there's a need for counter-balance to all the reviews overrating this movie."
721,"If this wasn't named ""Parasite"" I'd be running to the theater to watch this.",mvrk,10 February 2020,9,"The problem is that the Koreans and Japanese and other people from that side of the world make so many disturbing movies that I just don't watch them. Now the name of this movie is ""Parasite"" and that doesn't fill me with confidence. But I've been assured that this is not a disturbing movie so I'll go give it a chance. But the one thing I have to say, only in America can a foreign language film win best picture in the greatest award ceremony of the year."
722,One of the greatest films I have ever seen,mak1411,9 December 2019,10,"One of the greatest films I have ever seen
The movie directing and the inferences that the director used to direct the film were very genius
The acting performance is great
Worth winning an Oscar for Best Foreign Film"
723,Must Watch . Very Different And Very Attractive,dhole-shubham,10 February 2020,10,Best Movie 2020 . Sure Shot Oscar In every Compition . Worth watching .
724,Bong Joon Ho Directs another Winner,billcr12,21 January 2020,9,"Bong Joon Ho directed one of my favorite movies of 2017, Okja, and has done it again in 2019 with Parasite. A working class family worms their way into the lives of a wealthy family with unexpected results. Ho has written a sardonic satire which loses nothing in translation from Korean to English. Koreans, like we American counterparts, have a 99% and a 1% who look down on the rest of us with disdain. The script is right on point and the entire cast is excellent. Easily one of the ten best films of 2020."
725,A Tour de Force,nancyldraper,26 January 2020,9,"This is quite a tour de force, scooping up all the prizes in this award season (so far). It begins as a comedy of circumstance but takes a decided turn into some unexpected genres. The story is surprising and multi-layered. Your allegiances will shift throughout. The acting is superb. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Comedy, Thriller, Drama}"
726,"PARASITE: Dark, Socially themed, Multi-dimensional, Highly thought-provoking and an incandescent cinematic roller coaster!",koushikdas508,10 February 2020,10,"Korean films are love. Yes, they are! 'Oldboy', ""The Man From Nowhere"", ""I Saw The Devil"", ""The Chase"" etc. etc. You name it. Korean directors are masters when it comes to deliver messages about social taboo or to execute a thriller on screen in possibly the most perfect way. 'Parasite' adds and in fact stretches the legacy of Korean films in even broader perspective.
Genres can be deceptive at times for some cinematic creations. And for films like 'Parasite', it spans over a wide sphere for sure.
Kudos to the director Bong Joon-ho for giving this masterpiece which is multi-layered and shows the economic inequality in the pro-capitalist society of South Korea in a way which consists so much mixed emotions, sense of humour, lots of adrenaline rush, few nail-biting moments as well; all revolve around primarily two economically contrasting families. It pin-points out the drawbacks of extreme capitalism and plutocracy in its usual neo-noir black comic style, which will eventually grows on the minds of the audience.
No wonder why this cinematic gem has got almost 10 mins of standing ovation at the Cannes and has won 4 Oscars at the 92nd Academy Awards including ""The Best Picture"" award as a Non-English film for the first time ever in the history of the Academy Awards.
It's rightfully the MOVIE OF THE YEAR OF 2019!"
727,Watchable,analeonorcastro,28 January 2024,7,"For me it's not worth the hype and not Oscar worthy at all.The story is good but the execution is far from great.The characters are not developed enough for you to sympathize with any of them. For example you have no context and never get to know the personality of the son in the poor family which is just one of the main characters.The acting is exaggerated and shallow and leaves you wondering if it's supposed to be a comedy but then it doesn't get to be funny. On the other hand many reviews say it's a thriller, but it never made me care what happens if they are caught.Some parts are also very implausible, for example in the final scenes, where people randomly live / die independently of the severity of the injuries.Then there's the social inequality theme. Low income people are portrayed as the scammers, so I wasn't able to sympathize with them.Couldn't rate it higher than 7."
728,ONE OF 2019'S BEST...!,masonfisk,9 December 2019,10,"Bong Joon-ho's (Snowpiercer/The Host) latest is coming to local screens w/the Palm D'Or stamp of excellence & it is well deserved. This twisty long con of a film finds a down on their luck family (downtrodden due to their own circumstances or the current economic paradigm in South Korea?) who thanks to a friend of the college aged son gets an opportunity to get a job as tutor for a rich family (the daughter's grades aren't up to snuff, at least according to the overprotective mother) but once he gets his foot in the door he finds he can bring the rest of his disparate clan (his mom, dad & sister) into the mix. His sister comes in as an artistic coach to the well-off youngest son & elaborate schemes are perpetrated to oust the driver & the maid (who worked at the property w/the architect of the manse) so that his parents can fill in those slots. So far so good (depending on whose side you happen to be on since the elite clan is depicted is out of touch & inheritors of the new Korea) but then a genius twist happens which throws the entire plot upside down, forcing our anti-heroes to make a decision which will effect their world. Wonderfully delineated as a lighthearted (at least for the most part) 'me against them' (there's a wonderful sequence where the working family rushes home in the rain & their journey home is literally a descent into hell) which rides the fine line between cruel & mirthful. One of the year's best, catch it!"
729,"Upsetting premise, goes down hill from there!",barbarapochan,4 November 2019,7,"Ok ok, I've got to give it to the filmmakers that this unusual film is beautiful shot & acted. But for me, it was also a disheartening mess, taking dreadful closterphobic turns as it descended into the depths."
730,Shocked by the great reviews : Are they fake?,honeybloggs-69648,23 December 2021,2,"The film started off well and an interesting concept started developing However , it suddenly turned into mayhem and utter stupidity . It was nonsensical .Yes, I got the message about the rich and poor divide etc etc but that's nothing new and just reality . I was disappointed in this movie as I'd read great reviews. It was an utter waste of time !"
731,Bong Joon-ho's drama/thriller/comedy is definitely worth seeing,cricketbat,31 January 2020,8,"It's hard to nail down what type of movie Parasite is, but this drama/thriller/comedy is definitely worth seeing. Bong Joon-ho tells this story in a way that keeps you engaged and keeps you guessing, with protagonists you can't fully like and antagonists you don't really hate. Even though I may not agree with every decision this film makes, I enjoyed the journey and I'll be thinking about it for a very long time."
732,"This is a very very intriguing movie, See it!!",desperado_here,23 December 2019,10,"In some ways its kinda scary and its because you never know who you think you know. Also, this movie in some ways reminds me of Sweenie Todd and The Family in one. Anyway, better than both and is a must watch!"
733,Well....I didn't expect 'that' after the first half. That's for sure!,iquine,5 February 2020,9,"(Flash Review)WOW! I did not see all that coming. The film sets the stage with this severely lower class family who live in a crappy garden apartment who hatch a plan to fake their way into a wealthy family's life to feed off them like parasites. They are doing real services but under a false guise while earning the family's trust. With ample tension and drama there, the film then shifts up a gear with a surprise revelation about the previous housekeeper. Topping that, the film shifts into high gear with a wild grand finale. The story was original, well-written and semi-believable with twists that don't cheat the viewer. Complimented by great cinematography and editing made the film gripping and captivating. This film can be analyzed from several angles and is aptly named so watch, enjoy, ponder."
734,Parasite (Gisaengchung),JoBloTheMovieCritic,26 January 2020,10,10/10 - undoubtedly original and captivating...this is why we go to the cinema
735,A beautiful masterful foreign experience,UniqueParticle,1 February 2020,10,"My second time seeing a subtitled film in the theater after Raw 2016 and Parasite was so worth it! It's about a family that lives in a little house that want better things. Such a gloriously well filmed story in every aspect including the cinematography, writing, production design, and captivating characters! Well deserving of the awards/nominations; unfortunate people didn't like the movie."
736,Bong you did it,alansabljakovic-39044,7 December 2019,10,"This is the best movie of 2019, over.
RESPECT, over."
737,A great story but definitely not Oscar winning,rish2006,19 February 2020,7,No doubt this was a great film with a strong plot but not that awesome to win an Oscar award - otherwise this film is definitely worth that watch showing some humor and suspense.
738,Masterwork,ferdinand1932,10 February 2020,9,"It is demonstrably an excellent film within the first 15 minutes and it gets better. It has a very good script, one which is honed with good characterization and motive, together with fine structural exposition. No other script in the 2020 Oscars has the qualities that this one has in terms of writing skill.In terms of execution, the directing and other technical components, all coalesce brilliantly. It is probably the editing too where so many remarkable films excel that lifts the film again. The sequences in the house between the families are memorable here as the tension is raised with so much at stake.The story has many layers which are relevant to this time: chiefly inequality, but also other themes too which are touched on in deft ways and through the characters so as to move the story along toward its rather terrible conclusion.
The ending is somewhat classical; a purge clarifies the entire drama, and it is effective in its own terms, but it also the only part of script that is not entirely ideal. Other choices might have been made which do not make the one we see an error.Signalling 'wokeness' is pointless with this film. It is a very good film and will be referenced by film makers and students for years to come. That durability is honor indeed."
739,"creative, different, and intriguing",FeastMode,17 February 2020,7,"This movie grabbed my interest immediately and never let go. well-made all around. a memorable experience. (1 viewing, 2/15/2020)"
740,Oscar joke,alexwatlington,15 February 2020,3,"The Emperors new clothes, that sums up the reaction to this movie. This movie is the modern day ""Slumdog Millionaire"". One of the strangest Oscar decisions ever. It's not a bad movie by any stretch, but a masterpiece? LOLOLOLOL, no - not at all. The acting is average, there is little character development that is compelling, the script is boring, zero humor. At no point does this movie grip you and beg you to keep watching to learn where it goes. Years from now like ""Slumdog"" we will look back, especially at the cinematography and laugh at how great we thought this was."
741,Masterpiece.,Azanspy,8 January 2020,10,This is cinema in its purest form. Parasite is pure art and that movie which we should recommend to people who don't watch movies and show them how good cinema is. Parasite is an exhilarating experience and a movie which scored full marks in every department. Bong Joon Ho is one of the best directors in the world right now with this masterpiece. The message the movie gives about different classes of people really strikes us and it was done by some very powerful performances. The whole cast deserves our applause. Parasite is that movie that we won't forget about for a long time even if we watch it only one time. Hats off.
742,Wow,MrHaversham,11 February 2020,10,Didn't have to time to watch before the Oscars. Just have and all awards duly deserved (even if there had been better competition). A movie to leave you speechless. It really is that good.
743,Among the best films of this decade!,kidsmakemovies2,5 November 2019,9,"If Memories of Murder did not solidify Mr. Bong's place as one of this century's greatest artists, then this film certainly did. I cannot remember the last time I saw a film this great in theaters. By a full 1.5 stars, this film has replaced Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as my favorite film of 2019. Of course, that is subject to change, but I can't see this being beat any time soon.Parasite is a film about which I think I should say as little as possible. Knowing nothing about the plot going in was a great benefit. The film has so much to say about class, about wealth, about family, about society. It is all so focused and direct. The movie never meanders or wanders off to other topics. It is excellently paced and has fantastic editing. The script is so well-written, both in terms of dialogue, progression of the plot, set-up and payoff, reincorporation, and commentary. The film looks fantastic, as most of this director's other pictures do. The music is pretty great, very well timed and sometimes used for comedic effect. The acting is great, too. Song Kang-Ho is great as usual, but the younger actors and the women do great as well. I especially loved Jo Yeo-Jeong's performance. I think watching this in theaters is definitely worth it if you can manage.I loved this movie. I think it is a pretty accessible foreign film. My showing was pretty full, and the next two showings were sold out entirely. I'm really happy that people are watching this, and I hope to God that the movie gets the Academy recognition it deserves.9.5/10, could be a 10 on the second watch."
744,I really can't compare it to any other movie,alansabljakovic-39044,24 August 2019,10,Probably the best movie of this year. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie. Acting is so natural and trailer didn't reveal anything to me and I'm grateful for that. This is another Korean masterpiece and it reminds me a little of Oldboy. It is shame that I had to watch it online because they aren't showing it in my cinema.
745,This decade's masterpiece,alansabljakovic-39044,2 November 2019,10,I can't get enough of it. I watched it second time and it is even better than first time and first time was like amazing amazing.
746,Not a leech (?),kosmasp,15 January 2020,10,"Of course Parasite could be anything ... which is why you should avoid Spoilers at all costs. Many have made a point about this and they are right. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, you want to talk about everything. Performances, story and all of it.If you don't mind the subtitles go for it. I am expecting there to be an American remake anytime soon. So watch it before it becomes a thing. Especially now with the Golden Globes win and Oscar recognition (both deservedly!). South Korean cinema especially concerning drama and thrillers is really something I can advise anyone to watch. The quality is high and there are many things to discover. Not to mention they deliver surprises for anyone watching ... which is a good point for this movie too!"
747,One Of The Best All-Round Films Of The Year,CinemaClown,3 September 2019,No rating,"A meticulously crafted & confidently narrated black comedy thriller that offers a biting take on the socio-economic state of modern South Korea, while also taking a jab at late capitalism, the 2019 Palme d'Or winner is Bong Joon-ho's most mature & accomplished film to date that finds the distinguished filmmaker at the apex of his craft, and further cements his position as one of the brightest storytellers of our generation."
748,Not as good as they said,Abdulxoxo,24 June 2020,7,"The Kim family who are the main characters are not likable at all and greedy too. They do things very irrationally. The first half is quite empty and a bit boring. The park family are so gullible too but they are much more likable as the.... say the bad guys?Mr Kim - the father: his character got the most problem, as the father he didn't make good decisions for the family. He decisions are really bad. They got a young man fired, they don't care if he's poor and miserable as they are. They only think about themselves - selfish.They found out about the maid's secret but instead of negotiating something. They chose to fight all over the place.Mrs Kim the mother is heartless too, she pushed the poor maid down the stairs which ultimately ended her life, and then they tied them up in the bunker, wounded, no food and they go on to live their lives normally. And they expect to find them alive in the following morning?And what's up with that rock, I thought it was going to be used for something important but no it was there all this time so that it would used to smashed the son's head. lolThe party is where everything goes wrong. When the bunker guy show up and stab the kim sister and looking to kill the mother, it wasn't Mr Kim's problem at that time, his mind was totally on Mr park, and helping his family comes second I guess. he went ahead and stab Mr Park even though he employed him and pay him good money. He then left his bleeding daughter and son and his wounded wife to go hide in the bunker. Gimme a break.the behavior of the Kim family can't be excused because they re just poor. Poor people don't normally behave in an erratic way and are contented.And since both the Kim family and the Park family helped each other in certain ways, knowingly or unknowingly, isn't their relationship symbiotic? I mean it's not parasitic since both are benefitting from each other right? the Kim family get to enjoy the life of wealth while they are taking care of the Park family's kids and house. the relationship is symbiotic, therefore the film's title should be Symbiosis not Parasite in that case hahaha just sayingThe film overall doesn't left as much impact
on me as say joker did."
749,An instant classic.,MOscarbradley,16 December 2019,10,"If you must make a home invasion movie do it as a comedy and not as a horror film, right? Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" arrives already festooned with awards and rightly so. In this gem a family of low-life con-artists manage to take over the home and lives of a softer and much richer family that in some ways mirror them. It's like ""Us"" but without the supernatural element. Of course, a scheme like theirs can't succeed without something going very wrong which, of course, it does turning ""Parasite"" beautifully and brilliantly into the blackest of comedy-thrillers that does finally manage to erupt into just the kind of horror flic we expected from the start.With pitch-perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year, not to mention the kind of home any family would be happy to invade, this is an instant classic. I can already see the American remake but it will never top this. It may not be quite as profound as it would like to be but for sheer cleverness it's up there with the very best."
750,This movie got this much attention only because of the Oscars,shubhamjohri-2012,17 September 2021,7,I didn't feel their was enough buildup to justify the abrupt criminal act at the end of the movie. Felt contrived and forced.
751,Neo-Marxism and Inverse Snobbery,montferrato,4 February 2021,1,"Repulsive story, highly prejudiced. The movie deals very unsuccessfully with the topic of social class struggle. Basically, the movie offers a violent tale of resentment and inverse snobbery. The rich are stupid and undeserving, the poor are a brotherhood of crooks, etc. It both denigrates rich and poor at the same time. It criticises capitalism and meritocracy but offers no alternative whatsoever. There is a dangerous apology of social revenge ( in the view of the movie, which sides ideologically with the poor, these are justified to kill the rich). It furthers violence, division and polarisation.
Repugnant view of the world. Biased, Immoral, Unreal. Pure unadulterated prejudices.
Not surprised that Cannes and Hollywood give it prizes. These awards are clearly political. Cinematic Quality has nothing to do with it. All this hype furthered my opinion about the inherent detestability of this very bad movie. Overrated is an understatement. Sick film, sick story. We live in decadent times. It is obvious."
752,its not a new idea,ops-52535,10 August 2019,10,"But its an amazing movie to follow from start to end. it has humour, sorrow, genial twists and lures, marvellous acting from the entire cast. the filmography is a marvel itself, and should be seen even though you might not like south korean film.the transitions between scenes are what i call supersmooth, and very well spiced musical score, that makes you relax as well as take your breath away of shock jolts that appears from nowhere.its a comedy satire, with a whole lot of wishing well realism, a quick look at south korean sosciety, the extreme contrasts , and the serendipidness of life that makes a grumpy old man impressed. its a top notch flick and its highly recommended."
753,BEST PICTURE goes to PARASITE,reveshcity,10 February 2020,9,"I watched this movie (before Oscars) and I know this movie will get awards for sure! And I just came to know that this movie got BEST PICTURE on Academy Awards! WELL DESERVED!Parasite created a history in Academy Awards!
A MUST WATCH!"
754,Unforgettable and original,phd_travel,18 December 2019,10,"Stunning. This is a movie of superlatives. Every aspect of this movie is well done from the original story to the acting and directing. It is a drama, comedy, unbiased social commentary, thriller - a lot in one.The completely accessible and involving story is well written and constructed - every scene has a purpose. Given the extremes that this story goes to - it's still plausible - the thriller elements don't get out of hand or descend into stupidity. There is a social commentary on class and wealth that is so effectively laid out from start to finish. It has changed the way I
think about relationships across the wealth divide.Don't read anything about the story before you watch it. Just go and see it.This Korean cast and director have made an unforgettable film that will be talked about for years to come. And it deserves every accolade out there."
755,A Masterpiece,linasharar,10 February 2020,10,A must watch .. mesmerising with mixed overwhelming feelings throughout the two hours.. it doesn't leave you after it ends; you cannot help but continue think of what if!
756,An absolute masterpiece,onkylonky,23 January 2020,10,"Parasite is one of the most original creative films I have seen in many years. Its tense, funny, heart warming, shocking, all in one film. The acting, and writing is absolute top notch. I can not recommend this movie enough."
757,Parasite is not a valid title for this brilliant movie,teodoreh,17 December 2019,8,"It's a nice-to-watch movie and nice-to-think afterwards of what you've just saw.At first, it feels you are watching a single-sided comedy, in which a family of poor-devils manage to build a scam against naive rich people. But, 45 minutes later, you see something different.It is a very strong contrast to see the father of the family on the same scene, trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is ok.The ending is not the best I could think of, I guess, rich people will keep living and poor people will keep dreaming.Very strong and meaningful pictures, painting a country that is supposed to be of the wealthiest in the world, showing that the barrier between rich and poor people is opening everywhere. The main characters is like they're living in North Korea if you think of it!Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show that nobody is good or evil, nobody is right or wrong. It's just the situations that make us react the way we do. I am not even quite sure who's the parasite. Poor people who discover a window for (a better) living or rich people who take advantage of lower-class people in order to obtain their wealth, not knowing how it is, to be poor?"
758,It's entertaining but overestimated.,Fernando-Rodrigues,9 July 2021,7,"I already saw the comment on capitalism and the other layers of human nature and relationships other times in other films. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, maybe that's on me and my expectations."

760,Seriously Overrated !,kingsleyabi,30 June 2020,6,Did i just watched a different movie ? I don't Know after reading all reviews i was quite excited and had hopes on this film. The overall concept of this film is good but definitely overrated i watched many films better than this which the critics and audience failed to appreciate. But this one is not up to the hype that the critics .
761,Sadly I felt it was overrated.,anoria,22 July 2020,5,"After watching this ""masterpiece"", I felt as if there was missing something, or a major twist was left out.
I was told by plenty of people, that you would be amazed about the twists, and there would be a lot of surprises. Which sadly didn't happen, and I really felt that it was missing that huge ""WHAT!?"" feel, which never came.
Everything was so predictable, and there wasn't as much comedy as expected.
I wouldn't see it again, but I'm good now that I have seen it tho."
762,More than just a masterpiece,divyangkundaliya,18 December 2019,10,"Its really difficult for a new film to come out & satisfy me & outperform well known masterpiece thrillers from the sixth sense to modern mystery inception
But this movie did exactly that i loved this movie more than fight club, inception, se7en,gonegirl,shutter island
Give it try for first 5 min, then. U will witness the greatest achievement in filmmaking of this decade
This movie has set new standard which i think difficult to crack for normal director"
763,Twist after twist will create cold waves inside your lumbar spines.,ahamedfahimq,31 January 2020,9,You will experience twist after twist while watching this movie. It contains very mild but catchy dark humour. Some scenes will create cold waves inside your lumbar spine. You will be thinking the ways to get rid of the troubles along with the characters of the movie.
764,"Clever plot that twist with a surprise call it good verus bad, rich against poor, overall great film!",blanbrn,21 January 2020,9,"Director Bong Joon-Ho really did it with his latest picture ""Parasite"" as it is one entertaining dark suspense drama that is revealing as the plot twist with a surprise which brings change for all of the characters. Despite reading subtitles the film is thrilling and entertaining as it involves the poor Ki-taek family who have a young boy and girl who become tutors to the kids of the wealthy Park family only a scheme really lies underneath it all only an incident happens and a discovery changes the game for all, still the Ki-taek family is stubborn and proud as they will do anything to survive. Overall good take and spin on class that's supported by shrewdness, suspense, intrigue, drama, and pumping black heart like comedy. ""Parasite"" by far by the way it entertains and grabs you was one of 2019's best films."

766,Really derserves Oscar,ergunbul,13 February 2020,9,"The acting,the story, the surprises and tension of the film is amazing. Shows the poor side of South Korea as well and the difference between rich and poor is ironically presented in many scenes. Watched 2 hours in one breath. Applause for this movies to creators."
767,Smells Like Poor Spirit...,ElMaruecan82,10 March 2020,10,"For reviewers, universally-acclaimed and awards-sweeping movies call for immediate viewings and reactions, whether along the enthusiastic stream, or the other way (the eagerness to express a dislike being even greater). With Boon Jong Ho's ""Parasite"", I wanted to write a review as soon as I finished it.But I was puzzled by that bloody climax. The last South Korean masterpiece I saw was ""Old Boy"" and if I was riveted by the story, the violence disturbed me no matter how relevant to the plot it was. Now, I didn't expect that film that started like a fun comedy of errors leaning toward screwball to generate such a hyperbolic outburst of violence. It wasn't even black comedy but straight out drama. I wasn't sure I liked it, but I wasn't sure I hated it either. I guess I had to sleep on it and figure out what Boon Jong Ho was telling us. So, here's my personal take, and apologies if I don't mention the actors' names, with the exception of the father played by Song Kang Ho.First of all, this is not a spoiler-free review, which allows me to get right to the point.Having digested the film now, I realized that Boon Jong Ho didn't make a comedy at all, which makes senses. I don't think the film would have won the Golden Palm or the Best Picture or all these awards if it was a cute comedy of a family of con-artists. Of course, the film Is encrusted with many humorous bits but so was Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"", a film less celebrated for its humor than its sharp blow against white liberals. Retrospectively, I find it obvious that the director and screenwriter was preparing us to a fatal clash between the classes, but I didn't expect it the catalyst, and film's leitmotif, to be something as trivial as ""smell"". You read me.There are three key scenes in my opinion that build up to the final rage that will lead the father to kill his boss, despite the total absence of enmity between them.1/ ""They have the same smell"": we've come to the comical momentum where every member of the ""poor"" family got a job in the rich property. They're all fitting in the family, appreciated for their work and yet it's the little kid who smells something 'fishy' in the way that they all smell the same. Bong Joon Ho doesn't treat it as the hint that there's something fishy about them (which a lesser director would do) but that they live in the same ramshackle house with all the street and fried onions stink sticking to their clothes. They smell because they smell like poor people. The smell symbolically blows their cover.2/ The hidden-under-the-table scene: what could have been used as a slapstick moment gives more depth to two key characters: the fathers. Laying on the sofa, snuggling with his wife and watching his son outside in the teepee, the rich father compliments his driver's work but laments about his terrible smell. Notice that the comment is paralleled with another one about him knowing how to stay in his place. Also notice the father's reaction, he realizes that he's not just a man or a valuable employee, he's got the smell in the package of appreciation. Notice that the comment is said in secrecy during an intimate moment because in real-life, we never tell anyone about his smell, only a child can be that careless. But the father's comment resonated like an indisputable verdict, one that reduced the father (and automatically his family) to their poor and stinky background, like the untouchables in India. Speaking of India, the scene is followed by a huge flood in the lowers streets... that feature the third key scene.3/ One last cigarette: while everyone is trying to save whatever valuable hasn't been taken by the waters, the daughter rushes to the toilet where huge sewage cascades are propelled from the bowl, spilling all over her body. Without minding the foulness, she just sits down and savors one last cigarette. We realize how familiar to the low depths these people are, that smelling anything is barely an issue. They don't like it, they just don't have the luxury of caring, but from the rich ones' perspectives, people who don't mind the stink, stink physically, and then symbolically.So, no matter how friendly the relationships are, they clash each other on that iron curtain made of streets, sewage, gasoil or cooking fragrances and bourgeois hypocrisy. Which all naturally leads up to that moment where having just seen his daughter stabbed to death, the father must give the car keys to his boss to take his boy to emergency. The keys lay under a dead man's body and the rich father is repulsed by his smell; one time too many. The poor father who should be angry toward that man who took his daughter's life, directs instead his anger toward his boss, tracing an ironic line of solidarity with the killer... because he knew the hardship he went through inthat bunker and the respect he showed to the house master only to be reduced to a smell, him too.If there's one movie that shows in powerful symbolism the battle of classes, it's ""Parasite"" and the mood whiplash at the final act was like the detonation of a talent. Boon Jong Ho proves that Asian cinema is one to rely on, an Art that tells inventive stories and make them insightful and relevant and entertaining. It also reminded me of my criticism of former Asian Golden Palm winner ""The Eel"", where I wished the film left the bloody scene as a climactic flashback. Blood is a big narrative expense and should be left to the right moment to implode its meaningful or cathartic power.I was puzzled first but once I got that leitmotif, I could see the genius."
768,"Brilliant, except the end...",mt_veto,26 September 2023,6,"This film has one of the most compelling premises and buildups in of any film in recent years.However, the ending left me rather cool and I felt that a story with such a gripping narrative should have something a little more well thought out.It's almost as if there is a genre switch near the end of the film. Where it goes from psychological drama to cartoonish over the top horror. I'm interested to know if there was studio intervention on this point because it almost feels like another filmmaker took over.Unfortunately, this bend basically broke the reality of the film for me. But the primary build up of the film is so great its still definitely worth a watch."
769,Things completely moves in unexpected territory,robertoredbobby,4 March 2020,10,"I can't believe people have rated it 6/10. Just how? Not trying to point out fingers but it feels like most people are frustrated that a foreign movie won the Oscar and they wanted their favorite to win. Anyways everyone deserves to have their opinion.
I watched movie yesterday and gosh it was more than Perfect. Most of the time I regret watching a movie coz it's too predictable for me. This one blew my mind. I was literally worried about something might happen or other thing not to happen and the story completely flips to unimaginable plot.
Also the details in the movie that the director has gone through. Marvelous.
For me, I'll put this movie alongside Shawshank Redemption."
770,best picture? not sure,alir45,20 August 2023,7,"A film with a not very specific style. Average acting power, not so good screenplay, good direction, and overall an interesting and good movie, but not to the extent that the Oscar will give it the best picture. There were really better options to win in the movies of 2019. There are sequences in the movie that the viewer has no connection with and are just for the continuation of the movie, things happen that are not logical at all and the dialogues are extremely basic. I emphasize that the movie is a good movie for Korean cinema, but not to the extent of winning an Oscar. In the previous years, there have been much better movies in Korean cinema that did not receive any Oscar, such as Oldboy or Lady Vengeance. In general, I don't have anything else to say, I don't know, maybe I have a low cinema sense."

However, though many have slipped to the back of my mind, Parasite is the movie title on the edge of my tongue when asked 'what movie do you recommend?' and will be until the next movie blows me away like Parasite did (this may be a while). I watched this movie a while ago but decided to voice my opinion after last lights Oscar success. Very rarely do I explain so little about a movie and just explain to the person 'just watch the movie' yet until you watch it, you won't undertsand why. True Masterpiece."

777,"Brilliant, daring and original",CaptnCnck,16 February 2020,10,"Writer and director Bong Joon-ho has created a deranged masterpiece with Parasite. The first half of the movie was slow and repugnant to watch. Then, as the second half begins (when the former housekeeper shows up at night while the owners are away), it took a sharp turn into left field and became incredibly funny - though still very dark - and maintained the pace, humour and creativity right through to the end.This is not a formulaic movie for Sheeple. If you like black comedy, originality, creativity, foreign/Korean films and bold storytelling, then this is the movie for you.Laugh-out-loud, tears-in-eyes, wildly inventive stuff. Insane script, brilliant execution. Film art at its finest."
778,"Solid acting, atmosphere, music but the plot runs short.",sleepysunshine,13 March 2020,6,"I don't mind symbolism. I think it adds extra depth to a story, granted you're looking for it.
But if a story cannot exist strongly without symbolism...it's not really a story worth telling. This was one of them. The locations ran old after a very short amount of time and the ending was SO long and drawn out. And to come to what conclusion? Pretty flimsy."
779,Magnificent,colewaters,7 February 2020,10,Parasite is a must see film for the ages. It was fantastic a film that needs to be seen on the big screen. The acting was some of the best I have seen in years.Parents this film is rated R for language sexual content and violence
780,Direction and Logic,lily-15335,3 June 2021,6,"After all the hype I came away from this film terribly disappointed. I gave it 6/10 because the beginning captured me, then sadly the whole plot got lost in the brutality. I have seen better films about Rich and Poor come out of South Korea. Sadly this is not one of them.The story lacked good direction, and logic. It felt like the writers were struggling with the whole flow of the plot. Not something I could recommend as a must see."

786,Wonderful,Fangyi-2000,14 February 2020,10,"I was just stunned as the movie ends. The plot is both unreal and real at the same time. So unreal, so creative was the plot and so real was the depiction of sheer poverty and how that could possibly deconstruct people's moral..The way some scenes were shot shows clearly the power contradiction of characters, as when Ki-woo was entering Parks' villa, the surrounding was just pushing towards him.I really like some of the details of the movie's plot, especially when the Kim family fled back home in the pouring rain, probably looking forward for their shabby but at least rain-free dwelling, only to find out the basement flooded. The scene when Ki-jeong bled to death was also heartbreakingly realistic. No tearful words of goodbye to her father like lots of drams movies have done, the girl was just whining about the pain and asking her father to stop pressing on the wound. The scene when the Parkers' dog carelessly went to eat the kebab sticking to Geun-sae's back was also amazing. I might be over interpreting, but that scene seemed to be expressing that when a nobody like Geun-sae dies, nobody would care, not even human's best friend.Unfortunately I was not able to pay much attention to the actors' expressions when watching the subbed version.And although I have no trouble understanding the subtitles, the white words sometime just blended into the scene and I couldn't read them. Maybe I'll watch it online someday and figure out what I missed."
787,Gang Society Time,fanofmoststuff,9 February 2020,10,"I haven't watched many international films, mostly because I haven't been met with the opportunity of the will to actually go through with the commitment with finding the perfect film and taking my time to sustain it enough. But after hearing all the great reception of this movie I couldn't help but be intrigued enough to search for this movie. I was so happy when I saw it was playing in my local theatre, I rushed to go watch it with as little knowledge of the plot as possible, with the exception of the very vague trailer. And I'm glad the trailer I was shown was interesting enough to get my ass off to watch it but also vague enough to keep me at the edge of my seat the entire time I was watching it.
This movie is simply amazing. You see this movie and you immediately feel and think ""masterpiece"". It is funny, dramatic, thrilling, scary, thought provoking, intriguing, depressing, it is everything one can expect from a movie. This premise kept taking many twists and turns I was never confused. The beginning was slow but I was never bored. The jokes land delightfully especially since it had to be translated from Korean. I couldn't believe a movie like this could actually exist until the last 20 minutes I was snapped back to reality and realized ""OH RIGHT THIS IS HAPPENING NOW""
I have nothing against movies in other languages and from other cultures but I honestly didn't think I was gonna be left this impressed. I feel terrible that I had been missing out on such phenomenal works of art. I will mostly definitely try to seek out more of this director's work.
If this doesn't win Best Picture I will cry."

( which in this movie is not even portrayed as being amoral or deserving it in some other ways )filmed well, acted well, good thrills, but as expected in this genre, a shocking ending and a messy denouement.But nothing specialfor professional and amateur critics to comment that this is a rumination on class struggle, oppression of the poor and the comeuppance for the rich, just shows that they either never watched the film and allowed whatever political prejudice they have to write the film criticism for them, or that they are easily swayed by these professional critics."

One day the son manages to get a job tutoring the child of a wealthy family. He sees an opportunity to get his parents and sister jobs in the household too. Soon all of them of are in and life is looking much rosier. Then fate throws them a curveball.Superb. Written and directed by Bong Joon Ho who gave us the superb crime-drama Memories of Murder plus the entertaining Snowpiercer, Parasite is a great mix of comedy and drama, pathos and social commentary.It starts off in very entertaining fashion as we meet the family that are experts in cons and manipulation. It is quite funny and initially they just seem like slackers. However, after a while it is quite awe-inspiring to see the work that goes into their deceptions.As the movie progresses it becomes darker and darker. The plot takes on a few surprising twists and turns and the two families involved become symbols of a class divide. The social commentary is thought-provoking without being preachy or seeming biased. Powerful ending.Solid performances round out an excellent plot and great direction."

Soon, things start getting complicated.Parasite is a jaw-dropping film. Director Bong Joon Ho has given us another unforgettable movie, after The Host(2006), Snowpiercer(2013) & Okja(2017). Parasite has so many levels & nuances to it. This film, makes you experience a whirlwind of emotions. You'll laugh, you'll be on the edge of your seat, you'll be shocked, you'll be teary-eyed & you will be left ruminating about the movie, long after the credits roll. The performances are mind-blowing. Kang-ho Song is spectacular as Kim Ki-taek. Sun-kyun Lee is brilliant as Park Dong-ik. Yeo-jeong Jo is amazing as Park Yeon-kyo. Woo-sik Choi is outstanding as Kim Ki-woo. So-dam Park is fantastic as Kim Ki-jung. Jeong-eun Lee is excellent as Moon-gwang. Hye-jin Jang is awesome as Kim Chung-sook. Ji-so Jung is great as Park Da-hye. Myeong-hoon Park is superb as Geun-se. The supporting cast is memorable. Parasite is a must watch.

795,Modern Classic.,RhapsodyReviews,3 February 2020,10,"Review:
'Parasite' is a black comedy-thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho.
I personally love foreign films, especial horror and thriller films from South Korea. I have loved every movie I have seen thus far of director Bong Joon Ho's and this is no different.
The film follows the members of a poor household scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.
The actors in this movie bring their A-game and showcase all different levels on the screen. There are all able to showcase their comedic side as well as darker capabilities when needed. This is the rare occasion when there are no standouts because there are on the same level. Just brilliant performances all around.
The story is so original and tightly executed. It may get a little confusing because things tend to happen quickly, and information can get lost. It is beautiful shot, this its camera angles and wide shots inside the house. It showcases different class types in society perfectly and how some rich look down on the poor and it gets under your skin.
Overall, the movie is great for those who don't mind subtitles. However, if you do mind subtitles or have not tried foreign film, I promise you that you're missing out on a whole other world of cinema. I was going to give this movie 4.5 stars because I didn't just want to jump on the bandwagon with people loving this movie, but it deserves more than that. It is an absolutely flawless film.

All unemployed, Ki-taek and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident.
REVIEW
As the title suggests PARASITE..it symbolizes the entire plot of the film..the film starts off at a comedy film.. And slowly it turns into a intense thriller.. And finally into a horror film... The film focuses about the rich and poor.. Their goals and aims which bother us.. Exactly before the interval and the climax.. Characters in the film lay a foundation of extreme cinematic experience which was all spine chilling and mind boggling for sure.. The performance delivered by the KOREAN actors was stupendous and flawless.. The details introduced by the director was truly a masterpiece.. It was a great experience..

800,I thought this movie was overrated,idahola,16 January 2021,6,"I liked Bong Joon-ho's The Host, didn't care for Snowpiercer, and while I thought Parasite was decent, I definitely don't consider it the best movie of 2019, nor did it live up to the hype I heard beforehand. I however don't think there's some conspiracy by the Academy Awards or other American institutions to put international movies above American ones for some sort of ""social justice"", and I'm perfectly OK with them choosing an international movie if they just think it was the best movie of the year. There's been a few years in my time where I thought a non-American movie was better than the American-made ones that year.I was initially excited to see the movie, especially after hearing some hints of what it was about, and that it was a dark and stunning psychological take on people of different classes. I think class disparity is a huge problem in our country, so it felt very relevant. I also love dark psychological movies, but unfortunately after seeing this, I realized it wasn't that dark and wasn't that psychological. While it explores class disparity, neglect, and cruelty, there's so many problems with both the protagonists (if you can call them that) and antagonists (if that's really what they were).The movie's biggest flaws are mostly in presentation, but some of the situations and actions of the characters are preposterous and feel very contrived. It's a riveting watch, is fairly well acted and directed, memorable, and has interesting situations, but too many times I had to suspend disbelief to an almost comical degree. The movie does have dark humor, which I appreciated, but I think some of it is unintended. This reminded me of Snowpiercer, as that had so many preposterous situations that I couldn't help but laugh. I think this is almost a signature of Bong Joon-ho, which worked well in The Host, but not so much in these other two movies. I haven't seen Mother, so I'm not sure if it's truly a common or intentional thread in his movies. I've enjoyed a lot of Korean movies, but I think Joon-ho may be overrated at this point.I also think some of the violence is unnecessary and for shock value, and gets a bit overly-explicit, and some character's reaction to it is a bit odd and from my perspective a bit unbelievable and sometimes comes off as contrived. It seems in these more odd situations, Joon-ho is trying to make some sort of statement or point, which OK I think I understood, but I also don't like things like that being forced because they don't flow naturally with the storytelling and feel more wedged in. I don't know how political the movie is intended to be, but whether I agree with the points or not, I'd at least like a movie to have these ideas flow well and not be ratcheted in.I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy Korean cinema, topics about class disparity, terror/horror drama, and maybe even just something different to the typical American movie norm. It is well-produced and generally well-directed, the characters and situations are memorable, you'll be shocked, but ultimately if you're anything like me, you'll be disappointed but glad you saw it too."
801,Over hyped guilt trip,satilla,8 July 2020,3,"Exaggerated acting ( which even in Korean standards were terrible ) , really long unnecessary guilt trip to poverty. Most of the viewers will bored before the second half and the ones that say they loved the movie are just afraid to be labelled as ignorant or racist. I am not saying this is a terrible movie , but before declaring this one as One of the greatest in Asian cinema , try watching several Asian movies . There is nothing new or nothing eye opening about this movie. It is just another marvel of marketing. Anyway I will not suggest this one to anybody. Go watch les-miserables if you wish to watch a guilt trip movie with a style and quality."
802,Worthy oscar winner,RubyMouse,11 February 2020,8,"I loved this: it only came out in the UK this weekend and I needed to see it before the oscar winners were announced. The use of colour, space and sound is superb. The actors are perfect and it's just wonderfully funny and thrilling at the same time. I found it a little slow to get into but it was worth the effort: the poor of society are so often treated as like cockroaches; a different species, parasitic, work shy, undeserving. And, as one of the characters points out, if we were wealthy how much easier would it be for us to be kind and generous people? The wealthy here are not evil, simply oblivious."
803,The film of the year,cardsrock,6 February 2020,10,"The less you know about this movie heading in, the better. Parasite is a wonderfully original film from South Korea that manages to mix several genres together perfectly. This tale about class is filled with poignant metaphors and social commentary. Bong Joon Ho's vision and mesmerizing control over his craft make for an unforgettable experience.This isn't a simple rich vs poor story where there are clear protagonists or antagonists, and therein lies the beauty of Parasite. It's just murky enough to provide some true thought-provoking imagery and storytelling. Don't let the one inch barrier of subtitles prevent you from seeing this modern masterpiece."
804,great movie,camila_schuchter,12 February 2020,10,Such a great unique master piece! the kind of movie that surprises you. its hard to know whats coming next.
805,"Aesthetic, dark & political",stz-02952,22 February 2020,10,"First impressions: A striking contrast between the visual ambiance (smooth or pastel colors, cute) and the story (super dark).It kind of recalled me A Clockwork Orange somehow. The dark humor, manipulations, the underlying terror settling in, the sudden violence, the social questioning."
806,Banned in Canada,soltesglenn-07104,16 November 2019,10,"Just like the movie The Shape of Water ..... this movie is for all intensive purposes banned in Canada .....From the Cineplex site: The movie Parasite (Korean w/e.s.t.) is not playing in TORONTO - ON on 11/16/2019It is playing in Oakville in 1 theater. I will play the local art theater that seats 30 in my town later this month.Interestingly, Google Play has this movie and even has reviews BUT it is not rent-able or buy-able in Canada.Parasite is about the caste systems that operate worldwide, including Canada .... and is a taboo topic"
807,A NEW MASTERPIECE,dannyrovira-38154,9 February 2020,10,"Bong Joon Ho's absolutely brilliant and powerful masterpiece is a sheer work of cinematic art. It tells the twisted, funny, and ultimately tragic tale of class discrimination and greed. About an dirt-poor Korean family that lives in cramped half basement level apartment where drunks regularly piss and throw-up outside their window. The out of work father Kim Ki-Taek, played terrifically by Song Kang Ho, helps his wife Chung Sook, well played by Jang Hye Jin, and his two children, son Ki-Woo and daughter Ki-Jeong, superbly played by Chi Woo Shik and Park So Dam, fold food boxes for a pitiful low-wage, but that all is about to change and a sinister plan is about to come into play, when Ki-Woo with the assistance of of his sister who creates a fraudulent diploma which helps him secure a job as an English tutor for the teenage daughter of the super wealthy Mr. Park and his naive wife, Yeon-kyo, marvelously played by Lee Sun Kyun and Cho Yeo Jeong. Miss Kim is so impressed by Ki-Woo's teaching skills that she mentions to him that her younger son needs a tutor to improve his art skills, so Ki-Woo recommends an art tutor which unbeknownst to her is his sister Ki-Jeong. What follows is the escalation of the Kim family's nefarious scam as they slowly make the Park family replace their household servants, beginning with their chauffeur, who is replaced by K-Woo's father, then they replace their live-in housekeeper, with Ki-Woo's mother. The Kims have now thoroughly invaded and occupied the Park's home without them suspecting anything, but this insidious situation will soon turn dangerous and deadly in a truly shocking climax. This amazing film is a slow burn in the beginning as the story unfolds but once the Kims are in the Park's home the film becomes an engrossing and breathtaking dark drama with some wicked humor. Masterful Oscar nominated direction by Bong Joon Ho who was first Korean filmmaker to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Gorgeous cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong, and a captivating Oscar nominated Original Screenplay by Bong Joon Ho and Jin Won Han, impressive Oscar nominated Production Design by Ha-jun Lee and Won-Woo cho. A new classic that is nominated for 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture. In Korean with English subtitles."
808,It is just OK,lukasz-keska,16 February 2020,7,"I can understand there are a lot of people who really enjoyed the movie. It has good pace, there's a lot of tension and some unexpected twists. But honestly I cannot understand why so many people think this movie is a masterpiece, despite it flaws. And it has many flaws, unfortunetly most of them are in the story itself. For me they spoiled the movie. I was asking myself questions almost from the beginning of the story:
Why a smart, young, good looking, english speaking guy cannot find at least decent job?
How his sister, without experience or art/psychological education manages to conduct tutoring to the boy, with whom - as his mother said, couldn't stand any art teacher? First lesson we can see even the boy bowing to ""Jessica"" - did she hipnotize him or smth?
How she knew about trauma the boy had?
The fathee could drive modern, expensive car without proper experience or training. They were poor, so he does not drive at all, and as he said his only experience with merces cars were during short work as a parking worker. How he could play experienced driver?
How it is possible a woman without proper experience knows how to run modern house and how to behave as a housekeeper for a rich family? And how she could prepare a dish she did not even knew the name of in just 8 minutes, while being drunk and in a kinda hostage situation?
There is a scene with the Da-Song sitting in a tipi, writing the message of ""HELP"" that the husband of the former housekeeper is sending with morse cose via the lamp. The movie never addresses that later. Why the boy did not inform parents about that. And why nobody cared about strange behavior of a lamp, and strange patterns of the flashing light?
How it is possible the rich family did not know about a dungeon under their house and a man kept ther for 4 years????
There are just some of the questions I had. Main two ones are: why a family of so resourceful, inteligent and determined people live in a basement in a poorest of districts? With their talents they should be or on the top or in prison. Second - ending suggests we should sympatize with a father and his son. I have no idea how we can do that - they cheated, murdered and caused some innecent people to lose their jobs and reputation - honestly, there were no people in the movie I would like or had any sympathy for."
809,Great movie,gabriel-64769,12 February 2020,10,I am grateful to have learned to read early and not have problems with subtitles. Americans should try a little to be less lazy.
810,Didn't resonate with me,oliverarnell,19 December 2020,7,"As well crafted as this film is, with gorgeous cinematography, a decent soundtrack and brilliant acting, I just found it too much of a slow burner with no payoffs to justify it. I have been a fan of slow burners in the past, namely Interstellar and Bladerunner 2049 being two of my favourite films, yet they had arguably much better stories and spectacles throughout to make up for it. I heard Mark Kermode say this film delivers much of its plot visually yet I found the majority of the plot to be delivered with only dialogue or monologue. The supposed climax never really peaked enough, the horror wasn't all that tense or shocking and the comedy didn't land otherwise to carry it through. Furthermore, the references and foreshadowing throughout the film to later events could have been more creative. Finally, the 3rd act and ending felt like it could have been more meaningful and conveyed the Director's discourse with more conviction. Again, I don't want to deny the craftsmanship and deeper thinking into this film. There's some real consideration that's been put into this and a good attempt at making a pertinent and contemporary social commentary. Yet for me, it just didn't work.
Nevertheless, I invite you to try this one out for yourself."
811,Sad to see comments and awards,pablodiazpdz,14 March 2020,3,"The movie is bad quality, and seeing people trying to feel good about their social sensibility upon a garbage like this is to see how lost people are nowadays."
812,That's entertainment.,bock_g,13 February 2020,10,"Jumping on the post-Oscar win bandwagon, I went to see this film today. Having heard the near unanimous praise from peers and other reviews, I had high expectations for this film. It was also the first Korean film I watched. The movie starts, and I'm literally glued to my seat-it was very entertaining. The camera movement, the way the characters speaks, the overall pacing, the black comedy tone-everything was just so freshly packaged, I wanted a refill the moment the movie was over. A predominant theme of this movie is the class structure-from a non-Korean's point of view it was quite clear and somewhat tragic to see. If I had one problem with this film, I think some of the class struggle content was probably too overt (especially in the dialogue) and could have been handled more subtly. Despite that, it is definitely a film that deserved all the accolades it received. It is first movie that I watched in theaters where I instantly wanted to rewatch it. Now that folks, is entertainment."
813,a must watch movie,johnwikwikwikwikwik,10 February 2020,10,"The storyline, cinematography, is very very delight"
814,Incredible movie!,allen_guan,16 August 2019,10,Gonna be the Oscar winning movie! What a movie! It reflects the different level of society! Directly totally control the cadence which bring us into the deep thinking mind!
815,A POWERFUL FILM,typicalfilmmmaker,12 August 2019,10,A film talks about class dividends. performance wise all actors makes their job perfect.technically best all technical aspects are top notch. Bong joon ho delivers a gem.perfect film for palm d or in Cannes.

817,One of the best films I've seen in years!,lynnbaccaro,4 February 2020,10,"This movie is about so much more than class differences. It's survival,what you would do for your family.
Preconceived ideas of peoples worth and actions.
I was so nervous as the film came to a close. It was very intriguing! Wonderful!"
818,Reflect the truth of society,sirinyahollywoodthai,27 July 2023,7,"This movie is really reflect the truth of society, not even in Korean but many country around the world.The story is about the class differences in the society of Korean. The poor people want to have a better life to lived with rich people or be equal to rich people.It was an interesting movie. Reccommended.The end of the movie is not something I expected to see.Eventhought I don't like the end of the story that much but have to admitted that this is a good movie, it was something new worthing for the reward.The gab between rich and wealthy people and poor people was really real thing."
819,A quirky family comedy that transgresses into a vicious social satire on Korean class division,archiesmith,14 August 2019,10,"I just this for the second time in cinemas and I loved it just as much as the first time. I cannot describe how thankful I am that this gem has been given a wide release in Australia before most countries, which is a rare occurrence, especially with foreign films.The first time I saw this, I was absolutely enthralled by it because of the unique story being presented. I found it to be witty yet subversive, and I had no idea where it was headed. Bong-Joon Ho is a director who's work that I've seen at this point is something I greatly appreciate. He always manages to pull genuinely funny comedy out of his scenes that somehow feels natural rather than jarring. It doesn't diminish from the story's overall seriousness, nor does it ditract from the dramatic performances of the cast, especially Song Kang-Ho, who I have not seen give a performance that was not great yet.
Where the story did head completely caught me off guard, but in a good way. It is one of the best uses of plot escalation I have seen in a long time, to the point where the film completely changes genres halfway through and it's astounding because it works so well. The stylistic features change with the tone shift as well, as the score becomes more tense and dramatic, and the camera movement becomes more sweeping and eratic. It's all so perfectly complementary to what's escalating on screen. The cinematography is so good that any shot could be used as the poster, and it would make good one at that.The second time I saw this I payed extra attention to any hints or details that are presented which set up the escalation to come, and it was a truly rewarding experience. I think there's still things I won't pick up until my third or fourth viewing.I absolutely adore this film, and I think everyone should check it out. I would even recommend it to those who confess to not liking foreign films because they have to go through the gruelling task of actually having to read what they're watching.
This is my favourite of 2019 so far, and I would be very surprised if that changed from now."
820,"Way, WAY Over-Hyped!",thomasowen-65668,4 June 2020,No rating,"I'm afraid to say this movie is evidence to the press, PR and political agenda driven bile we are subjected to daily. Basically, it's 100% over hyped.
The emperors new clothes is an hour too long. It's a terribly crass, dull story that's simply well shot.
The movie and it's PR machine and subsequent Oscars are an insult to the peoples intelligence.
If constipation is your favoured hobby, dive in. If not... avoid."
821,Good but not out of the ordinary,judithws,11 February 2020,7,"Just watched the movie and can't say it lives up to the hype around it. It had funny moments, thriller moments and a message. It was interesting overall but the ending could have been better. I wouldn't recommend this film to a friend, for instance. Not because it was bad but because I felt that it was missing something."
822,Frustrating - tense at times but pointless,Christopher_Reid,17 September 2021,5,"Parasite failed to grab my interest near the start. Later on it picks up momentum and becomes quite engaging. But this is less because I liked it and more because it manages to keep the plot moving in unexpected directions. By the end, it felt like the exercise was a waste of time or worse. Worse because I worry that the filmmakers and many fans actually sympathise with the murderers, just because they're apparently poor.The premise falls apart when you think about it. While it's somewhat entertaining at first, seeing the main family lie a bit to get jobs supporting a rich family, it really sinks in that there's no reason for them to be poor. If the girl can fake university documents, if the boy can tutor English, if the father knows streets well and can drive confidently - why on Earth can't they get proper jobs? They can fake being qualified and well-off so they can succeed in job interviews!Little lies are one thing, like faking a degree to get your foot in the door. It's wrong, but it's not that bad if we're meant to believe there's some kind of unfair system. But after that, we see more and more how immoral, selfish and ungrateful the ""poor"" family is. As Dickens might put it, however poor they are in terms of wealth, they're much poorer when it comes to decency and morals.The girl lying about art therapy to manipulate the mother is appalling. Are we meant to find that funny? The way she talks about the rich family behind their backs is also very demeaning. The main bad things the rich family does is 1) be rich (so what?) and 2) complain about smell. Nobody likes bad smells. It's very reasonable that a part of progressing economically is taking care of personal hygiene. It's a practical thing, not a class thing.What they do to the previous maid is also terrible. Abusing her allergy. And planting underwear to frame the driver. The boy flirting with the girl he's meant to be tutoring.They don't care about the lives they ruin, as long as they get ahead. We never once see them apply for jobs. They use their intelligence to manipulate others and only progress by bringing others down. I felt that the only happy ending would be one where they all get killed by some psycho killer, or at least where they all get exposed.The best section is in the middle where a single night spirals out of control and keeps you on the edge of your seat. But even this was somewhat predictable and convenient for the writers. Why are they partying at this house? Who couldn't guess that an emergency would arise and the family would return early?The maid coming back and having her husband locked in a cellar was a nice touch. You don't know where the story is going from there. But while this could make for a decent horror or thriller, it doesn't gel with the rest of the movie, which is more of a comedy/drama.The ending is frustrating. I hated the poor family. They've now killed a woman on top of everything else. I understand the cellar husband's desire for revenge. But when the poor father kills the rich father? There was no justification for that. I liked the rich family. They were nice people. The father earned his money. The mother cared about her children and was very open and kind. The kids are normal kids.It makes no sense. The dad hides in the cellar. Sure. But you're telling me the police didn't look there? The son's bloody body was right next to the cellar entrance. They didn't search the room? Look at blueprints for the house? This guy comes out of nowhere, probably presumed dead, and goes on a rampage and they don't search the house more thoroughly?And it seems like the filmmakers want us to empathise with the murderous father. Sorry, but he should rot in jail. Along with his whole family who were complicit in all this. The maid was pretty crazy too, keeping her husband in a cellar. Wasn't she earning enough? Couldn't they pay off the debt, even if it took years? Why not be honest to the rich family?Parasite is misguided and extremely overrated. It's decent as a thriller/horror, at least for part of its running time. It has good acting and directing. There are a few funny moments. But the message is deeply confused and immoral. Poverty doesn't justify murder. Or lying or destroying other people's jobs.And if you have so many skills (the girl seems very smart and good with computers), why are you folding pizza boxes for a living? They can't get proper jobs? I call BS. Even when they all get jobs by lying, they don't move to a better apartment or improve their lifestyle. They're only poor because the script says so, not because it's remotely believable."
823,A Perfect Film,samansais,31 July 2020,10,"Parasite is done exactly how a perfect film should be.The exposition introduces the characters, their personality and characteristics, their significance, and what they mean in the context of the film in a way that is interesting, well-paced, and fresh. I deeply cared for the well-being and outcome of all these characters, and found myself taking their perspective and cheering on their misadventures. It's a difficult task to get an American audience to connect with an impoverished Korean family, but Bong Joon-ho does it perfectly.The narrative element is used more to paint a conceptual picture, giving us insight into the ambitions and motives behind the characters. The film takes long winding turns. Viewers who go in expecting an easy watch or a simple lesson are going to get much more than they anticipated.The film also does well to never put itself in a box. At times it is comedic, often thrilling, very dramatic, and sometimes even horrific. It has highlights in all categories of appeal.I have nothing bad to say. This is the first film I've watched where I was sure that every moment was done exactly right."
824,It's about the message,massmar,14 March 2024,8,"It took some years for me to finally see this movie and I'm still not sure how to place it.The most important thing about this movie is its message.It's about the Kim family living their harsh life in South Korea as they are without a job and without any perspective. On the opposite there is the Park Family living a privileged life in their luxurious home.By coincidence both lives get tangled up and there are apparently two worlds colliding. The story is very witty and the movie is sometimes funny, sometimes dark but never boring.For me this movie is quite entertaining but not that mind-blowing as some might think."
825,The emotional truth of class struggle,borgolarici,15 February 2020,8,"Being poor sucks and there is no poetry in misery: it stunts your emotional and sometimes even physical growth. Sometimes you can fight back and improve, sometimes you are just have to suck it up and surrender, which makes you bitter and angry.
This is what this movie is about: the loss of innocence of the poor and the blessed naivety of the rich."
826,Fantastic,taneesha-66477,18 January 2021,10,Honestly this movie is definitely one that lived up to the hype and deserved every single accolade and award. if you can watch a movie without staring at your phone for the majority of the film in this day and age it's definitely because the movie is capturing .. it had me hooked for 2 hours without being distracted
827,a true masterpiece,vad19894,17 January 2021,9,"Plot is perfect. there is just no flaw that is even slightly noticed. acting of all cast members are good. music accompanies scenes very well. the movie covers all genres without making any too much. funny, touching, suspending, sexual, family moments are all there, even horror ones. what left in your mind is a subtle yet powerful message about class discrimination in Korea. It truly deserves the Oscar without needing to employ politics or racial issues."
828,Can't say anything that hasn't already been said,quietgrave,31 July 2020,10,"The subtitles might be a bit much for non-koreans but the movie more than makes up for it. I complained when it won eight million academy awards because of all the other great movies but now see why it is so praised. A serious contender for ""Movies better than Old Boy""."
829,Probably one of the best films of the 21st century. For real.,anthonymigliori,26 August 2021,No rating,"There are times where we really deserve a good thrill from a good movie. If you're looking for one, then ""Parasite"" is one hell of a cinematic ride to take.Bong Joon-ho's direction calls back to the brilliant direction a master like Hitchcock would provide, which would be full of unique visuals and stellar composition. And, since I'm on the topic of masters, I am convinced that Director Bong Joon-ho will go down as not just a master of the directing craft, but also of the screenwriting craft. The screenplay, which he co-wrote with Han Jin-won, is full of not just so many twists and turns, but filled with so much genre-bending twists that there's never a moment where you feel the trope is overused. Both Bong and Han clearly know how to write a screenplay that is just as effective as say a screenplay like the one for ""Chinatown.""Then comes the performances of the cast. This film is a prime example of casting done right. Song Kang-ho plays Kim Ki-taek, the father of the poor Kim family desperate to break the boundaries set by classism and infiltrate the luxurious home of the Park family, with Lee Sun-kyun and Cho Yeo-jeong playing the father and mother, respectfully. Every single actor in this films shines like cinematic gold in their respectful roles.So, if you like films that are original, imaginative, thrilling, and oh-so brilliant acted, written, and directed, then please. Give Parasite a go. I promise, you will be in for a surprised. A really big one."
830,Worth the watch,annika-ac-brink,7 July 2020,6,"This movie is... memorable. I went into it not knowing what to expect at all, which is how I'd recommend others watch it as well. I would rate the movie an 8, but I find it hard to justify why. If I imagine the exact same story being played out in an American setting, it would get a 4 from me at most. So I settled on a 6... The storyline is absolutely rediculous, but you can't help but to keep watching. Interestingly, the movie doesn't convince you to root for the main characters. That might be it's biggest strength. This movie is definitely worth the watch, if only so that you can form your own opinion."
831,"Absolutely amazing, a masterpiece, but that ending...",andres-rosenberg,6 February 2020,9,"I just finished the movie and it's truly a masterpiece, from the combination of drama/comedy/horror to the detailed portrayal of social inequality...If I could point out just ONE thing I didn't like, is how they toss the writing right at the end. So the kid says he's going to get rich, and so he does? After the movie was making a clear statement of how difficult it is for the poor to level up? I just found that particular part to be ""too easy""... But other than that, it is a superb film."
832,Didn't meet my expectations,grahamf-55542,29 November 2021,7,"Given the overall rating on IMDB, I was expecting something a little bit more. It's a nice idea, and well executed for the most part. The ending...hmm. Perhaps it works in Korean culture but I found it disappointing, and it seemed to me that the writer just ran out of steam.But overall worth a look. The humorous touches were great."
833,"As they say, that's two hours I won't get back....",thebeez53,20 April 2020,1,"....and I thought ""The Shape of Water"" was a horrible Best Picture winner. ""Joker."" ""1917."" ""Once Upon a Time In Hollywood."" They all lose to....this? I just might be done watching the Academy Awards."
834,Absurdity of poverty,altanic-39237,17 February 2020,8,"This kind of story about poverty and inequality isn't uncommon throughout the rest of the world. They nearly always have a tragic ending because, and let's be real here, this is the only kind of ending most of the people in the world can accept as real. Things don't work out. That brief peek at happiness we see at the end? That's what the few fortunates might expect; it's how our stories typically end, and so it was a brutal but honest last point in case there was any doubt."
835,Gr8,gethinbloop,4 March 2020,9,"First things first, this movie has an incredible cast, all acting their roles with precision on the more serious times and humour when needed. Visually this movie was solid, with the camrea set-ups being almost poetic. I love the idea of infulltration and contrast in this movie, the idea of contradiction is very prevelant and very well done. This also has one of the tightest screenplays I've seen in a very long time, every single peice of dialouge contributes towards which every setpeice they are trying to sep up. The humour of this movie was absolutley spot on too, delivering clever and defining moments for almost every charcter."
836,"A Subtle And Meticulously Scripted Masterpiece In Its Very Calm Portrayal Of Comedy, Corruption And Murder!",silicontourist,1 August 2022,10,"This will most likely be in the top 5 list of Korean films for all time. Its an absolute masterpiece of genre subtlety that had me engrossed from the very beginning. It had already been out quite some time before I got to watching it because, I just wasn't drawn to it in any way. It came across as boring to me whilst reading the studio advertisement blurb. Luckily on one of those rainy day moments, not knowing what I fancied watching, I finally opted to watch it; and so pleased I did.Its a simple story of the existing life of poverty in South Korea (many people are destitute but the government hides it) and, a simple piece of luck that spiraled out of control into a full blown scam. The main 4 antagonists of the story are a deadbeat father, a miserable grumpy mother, a selfish foul mouthed daughter with the in your face attitude that kids have today and finally, a son who is the only decent person in the family and wants to better himself and his lifestyle.The way the individual actors portray their character roles is of extremely Oscar worthy performances. Everything is carried out in such a calm, peaceful and laid back manner; except for a bit of mayhem, at a garden party, at the closing stages of the film.Bad Language: YES...and not really necessary for the film...
Sex: NO...but some totally unneeded intimate lewd groping scenes...
Not a Family film but a superb one for the 16 and over viewers!"
837,8.5 average is a little too high,atrevino90,14 August 2023,8,"I likes this movie, I don't believe it did anything wrong but it{s also not better than many other films that are 8+ on IMDB, I thin it just got a little overhyped there hasn't been that many great films in recent memory. I would put this one on the same level as ""Knives Out"" or for example, a great film all around, entertaining, thought provoking, funny, easily digestible and memorable, but even with all those positives, I would not say its better than, for some examples, The Departed, Whiplash, Casablanca, Good Will Hunting. Lawrence of Arabia, Wolf of Wallstreet, even Three Billboards etc. Although to be fair there are many films with an 8+ average that should not be as high as they are either like Joker, and even som 7's that deserve to be 8+ like Tenet, it was just a little hard to grasp everything with 1 view and no subtitles, or Babylon, which was crazy, but it was also beautiful in it's own way.Anyway I am getting a little off the rails but the point is that when I saw it as number 36 in IMDBs top 250 it feels unfair for many other films that may be a littler harder to digest for the average person, but have a lot more substance. Is it a good film? Yes it is a great film, definitely recommended for just about anyone, but is it top 40 of all time? No, perhaps top 40 of it's decade at best but as someone who has watched a lot of films, I seriously doubt it would even be top 100, maybe top 150."
838,"Strange, funny and artistic",hooma814,18 December 2020,8,"It's easy to see why Parasite got so many Oscars. It's in that classic Oscar winning style of being quite artsy and something totally un-blockbuster like. These are always going to be movies that are enjoyable and have a great story to tell rather than just being about a feast of action for the eyes. Parasite has such a strange mix of humour and horror towards the end. Overall the biggest takeaway is the contrast between rich and poor. It takes you through such a stark contrast and the perceptions of both sides. The flood was a great example, for one family a bit of fun, for another you lose everything you own. In the end, we cannot assume that we would not behave in similar ways when we have had everything taken away from us and we are losing our lives. Quirky, but interesting."
839,*A Masterpiece That Unravels Society's Fabric*,chiragrathod19,21 July 2024,10,"From the very first frame of Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite,"" viewers are thrust into a world that feels both familiar and unsettling. This South Korean film cleverly intertwines dark humor, drama, and social commentary, creating a cinematic experience that is as uniquely compelling as it is thought-provoking.The narrative revolves around the Kim family, who, struggling to make ends meet in their semi-basement home, find themselves devising a cunning plan to infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Park family. What starts as a seemingly straightforward tale of class struggle rapidly morphs into a layered exploration of inequality, privilege, and the lengths one will go to for survival.Bong's direction is nothing short of genius. He crafts a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, continuously defying expectations. The cinematography is striking, utilizing the contrasting settings of the Kims' cramped, dilapidated quarters and the Parks' opulent dwelling to symbolize the vast chasm between the two families. Each scene is meticulously framed, capturing the essence of the characters' circumstances and their emotional states.The performances are sublime, with each actor delivering a nuanced portrayal that adds depth to the narrative. Song Kang-ho as Kim Ki-taek epitomizes desperation and resilience, while Cho Yeo-jeong as Yeon-kyo brings a naive charm to a matriarch unaware of the deception unfolding around her. Their interactions are imbued with a palpable tension, making viewers question the morality of each character's choices.What truly sets ""Parasite"" apart is its ability to oscillate between genres, seamlessly transitioning from drama to thriller to all-out chaos. It keeps audiences guessing, often eliciting gasps and laughter in equal measure. The film's climax is nothing short of a masterstroke, serving as a sharp indictment of social hierarchy while delivering a chilling reminder of the consequences of unchecked ambition and hunger.In addition to its gripping narrative, ""Parasite"" leaves viewers with lingering questions about society's structure. It serves as a mirror reflecting the disparities that plague our world, urging us to confront uncomfortable realities. It challenges the audience to identify with both the oppressor and the oppressed, blurring moral lines in a way that is both unsettling and enlightening.""Parasite"" is not merely a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that invites dialogue and introspection. It begs the question: How far are we willing to go for success, and what are we willing to sacrifice in the process? This film is a testament to the power of storytelling, proving that cinema can be both entertaining and enlightening.""Parasite"" is a bold, original, and expertly crafted film that will resonate with viewers long after the credits roll. It is not just a tale of class struggle; it is a haunting exploration of the human condition, making it a modern classic that deserves every accolade it has received. Don't miss your chance to witness this extraordinary cinematic journey."
840,Captivating,vivianla,15 November 2021,No rating,"I was glued to the screen from beginning to end.Park Seo-Hoon offers his poorer friend a job to tutor a high school girl he plans on asking out when she gets into university.

841,Probably the first proper review..,MooWoolf1,30 March 2020,6,"Let's start with that I've seen a lot. It's all public.
In the most cases meta's score given to a movie shows a better rating, a more realistic one compared to imdb.I've seen 1917, I was sick of that people don't even know what cinematography is.
The whole movie was made like ""Rope"" except that Rope had an amazingly interesting story. 1917 had nothing in it. Paths of Glory was in many terms a lot more realistic. Long story short, I didn't like 1917 at all. I had no idea why it was even nominated.Then I saw the Marriage Story. As soon as I realised Adam Driver is in it (Star Wars guy), I just wanted to not like the movie because I don't like the new SW movies at all. Then it turned out it was amazing. He was very good, the movie was very good. I liked The Irishman too but the Marriage Story was superior.Then came the awards and Parasite won. I saw it has a score of 8.6 and I know the director. He did a crime movie which I liked (Memories of a Murder). That one was very good.So I just watched Parasite too.It was interesting, but maybe I've seen too many actually good movies, so I do not blow my mind just like that.The characters were ok and maybe that's all. The story was just interesting. There was nothing special about it. It was an original story, but it won't make it good. It has nothing to tell us. It's pretty much like a half written mess.
If somebody works for me for years, I won't fire him/her just because a tale someone told me. I would atleast question the worker. Atleast! At this point the movie was very unrealistic.The smell factor. We can't smell it :) But all that food as whiskey on that table has a strong smell. You can clearly see under the table. I just had no idea how is that realistic.. They were all given good wages and still they didn't take a shower or anything like that. They did all smell bad.. Sooo unrealistic and because of it the father's motivation made absolute no sense. No sense at all. Especially in that situation.It felt like they had to end the story somehow and they chose this way for some reason.Other factors of the movie are no special neither.Roma stands on 7.7 and is by far better in every aspect.Currently I've rated over 2500 movies, I write scripts, I'm working on to direct one of my works myself and I have to tell you that this movie was just OK and I have really no idea why would anyone give it a score of 8 or higher. If I would write and direct a movie like this, I would be not satisfied. Not at all.
For me it was 6.5 as it was interesting. Also it's genre is drama/thriller. There was not a single second in the movie that was comedic!"
842,So over-rated but it has a good storyline.,EVON1TY,17 September 2020,8,"One of the most over-rated movie of last years. Rated as 30th best movie of all time? It can be in 150 but no more. Not that realistic (not because its comedy style, because it has wrong parts), detailed and effective storyline. It has wrong parts that could not happen, the nonsense parts I mean. I also watched Memories Of Murder, not so different than this movie, but Parasite is so over-rated. Over-rated on websites and Academy Awards.
I don't know how can be this movie the first Best Picture winner with foreign language. I know the Best Picture awards are not quite very well chosen. But we have seen amazing tens of movies from Italy, Spain, Turkey, Japan, Germany but none of them won the Best Picture in 100 years and this one won? Not that amazing and the other nominations was not that bad. Academy Awards only well chosen on Actor and Actress awards."
843,Found A Job,jfgibson73,31 March 2020,7,"I enjoyed this movie. It had some surprises in it, and I really couldn't predict where it was going to end up. It was extremely well made and well written, and the performers all did a great job. I guess the ending bothered me a little bit, but I'll admit it helped to reinforced what the movie was trying to say."
844,"Highly rated, but repulsive story",emailbillphillips,15 November 2019,1,"In spite of the excellent reviews, this movie was painful to watch and absolutely repulsive. It got worse the longer I watched. So, what's my problem? I'm a pretty intelligent, educated 75 year old, and I am willing to watch edgy stuff. I can list a dozen edgy foreign movies with subtitles that were excellent, set in Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, and South Korea, etc. There are many moviegoers like me who need a little affirmation of the human spirit in films. This film has none. And, the reviewers who have rated it so highly can only be suspect for there sense of humanity and value. Beware the Metascore!!!!"
845,Oscar? Really ?,hovhannisyankaro,14 March 2020,8,"This is a great movie and exciting scenario except from the ending.
The Oscars awards lost its reputation in my eyes.
The movie definitely doesn't deserve an Oscar and if it's the opposite then I'm the cruelest critic ever!!!"
846,PARASITE 💛💜💙💚,AdhilAramam,14 August 2019,10,"A beautiful journey of emotions.
Delivers a strong subject, so interestingly and with a bunch of great actors, incredibly directed by Mr.BongA very important film.
Kangsammidha"
847,That escalated quickly,caseyh22,25 June 2019,10,"At first, you'll see it as a comedy, but then the director take you on a magical mystery ride and you'll never know what waiting for you up ahead. 10/10 a must watch movie"
848,What a great masterpiece movie,khizernawaz,6 February 2020,10,Fantastic gtreatest movie. Win the best motion picture award really.
849,A Wildly Entertaining Social Satire from Bong Joon-Ho,willycp-31022,28 June 2019,10,"Social satire movies usually are serious, but Bong made this movie so thrilling & fun to watch. It will both make & ruin your day."
850,Korean movie niubi!!,user-263-214296,14 August 2019,10,"Nice and deep, great movie! This Korean palm is worthy of the name!!"
851,Not what I expected,k-57285-16523,3 April 2020,6,"The great thing about this movie is that rich people actually do nothing wrong. The husband and wife are loving, the children are gratifying, there is no derailment, there is no cold violence, there is no child abuse, and the driver and the servant are generous. Judging from the movies, they are stupid and have more money. They do not have their own main ideas. They are turned around by the poor, as if to play a role in highlighting the poor."
852,Masterpiece,mamunraju55,21 December 2019,10,Movies are about people. And this movie described struggle of lower class. A beatiful piece.
853,this movie was really good,pokemonfan-28334,10 March 2020,7,I'm still trying to wrap my head around this film. this film was really good from what I saw and it seems that Korea makes a lot of amazing films. the ending is what I remember the most like really what was that all about. this movie ws all over the place
854,Seriously? What did I just watch?,celtic451-228-782719,17 February 2020,2,"After seeing all the glowing reviews I feel like I am in an episode of the Twilight Zone. This movie was awful. The only reason I even gave it an overrated 2 is because it was weird. I like weird but this was goofy weird. Most of it didn't make any sense at all. The housekeeper kept her husband down in a secret dungeon and would bring him food every week and the rest of the time just ignore the fact he is down there by himself. The poor family couldn't even fold a pizza box then all of a sudden they are master con artists overnight. Then the guy in the dungeon goes berserk and starts stabbing the con family and no one seems to care about stopping him not even the family he is after - they let him attack the mom and they don't even try to help her. The husband just watches him attack his wife and doesn't even try to help. Then instead of attacking the attacker, he runs over and kills his boss! It make no sense whatsoever. One of the most bizarre and goofy movies I have ever seen."
855,A piece of art,vramirezampuero,12 February 2020,10,Absolutely Fantastic. The best movie i've seen in my life.
856,Masterpiece,masonsaul,7 February 2020,10,"Parasite is a masterpiece, an unpredictable film about class division that skillfully manages to easily combine different genres and create a truly unique and complex experience that's smart, funny and tense. All of the performances are incredible with Kang-ho Song, Woo-sik Choi and So-dam Park giving the standout performances. Bong Joon-ho's direction is incredible, it's beautifully filmed and the pacing is superb, constantly extremely engaging for the entirety of its run time. The music by Jung Jae-il is amazing."
857,Awesome roller coaster ride!,Thrillhorror,12 February 2020,10,The storytelling is amazing! Bong Joon Ho did it again.
858,One of 2019's best.,alvintalavera,14 August 2019,10,"Parasite (noun) - a person who habitually relies on or exploits others and gives nothing in return.This movie is one hell of a ride, it has a lot of unpredictable twists and turns which will make the viewers curious what will happen next. One of 2019's best. I loved the whole cast in this one."
859,"An epic dark comedy. Really funny, really dark, 90% epic",joachimokeefe,10 February 2020,9,"Two nuclear families - Mum, Dad, son, daughter; one filthy rich, one filthy poor. The first hour is about how the poor, conniving Kims take advantage of the rich, naive Parks in an old-school way that's like one of those classic Ealing comedies like 'The Ladykillers'. You have to admire their cunning - and luck, and the satirisation of both families' self-seeking ways is hilarious.After the first hour (there are two), of course, it all starts to go wrong in the way that classic Ealing caper movies used to do, except with severe - though not over-explicit - violence. And to an extent, so does the movie, which becomes a wild, morbid farce complete with plum extract, secret bunkers and barbeque bloodbaths. You start to feel a little claustrophobic about the fact that it all happens within the swanky architect-designed show house. Apart, that is, from the sewage floods in the Kims' squalid semi-basement.'Parasite' does have a solid story arc, sharp social observation, and mostly engaging characters though, and the poignant ending brings it to a satisfying close. It's quite old-school, but with an up-to-date take. Imagine a later Steve Martin comedy with cutting social observation. Did I mention the great acting?I do wonder what happened when the son's friend, who got him the tutoring gig in the first place, got back from university. Parasite II, anybody? (joke)"
860,Amazing,gabrielgameover,12 February 2020,10,"A really good movie, that deserved the Oscar, i was cheering for Joker but what the hell right?"
861,Overrated but entertaining,qwertoman,6 March 2020,7,"The first half of the movie is brilliant, unfortunately the main characters go from being geniuses with great social skills in the first half to being idiots in the second half. Considering their social abilities, they should have easily been able to make a deal where everybody wins or to manipulate their opponents to their advantage in the second half of the movie. Instead they turn into idiots so that we can get a ""social commentary ending""."
862,It really is as great as everyone is says.,matthewssilverhammer,7 February 2020,10,"A haunting parable, with so many stark images that will forever be burned into my brain. A pointed highlight of the differences between the haves and have-nots. A sublimely original movie that's full of surprises and unnerving but hilarious anxiety."
863,"Theme: Rich people are stupid, poor people are clever",andie-88941,11 April 2020,7,"The acting was great on the part of the con artist family. Mrs Park was just pathetic. Her character was played like she had an IQ of 50. I thought the story line as a whole was clever, but the very end was predictable. I knew exactly where the father Mr Kim went. I didn't like that he stabbed Mr Park. I didn't think that was in character, and it wasn't deserved. The poverty of the other family was not the Parks' fault. Their wealth inequality was just circumstance, and they were at the worst just ignorant. I couldn't root for the poor family because I didn't feel sorry for them. They could have used their wits to make better more honest choices to try and get ahead. Instead they chose to dupe people and take advantage of them. I liked that they showed the son at the end sitting in the apartment saying ""someday"" he will have enough money. A happy ending like the one they teased wouldn't have been fitting."
864,"Hugely overhyped, a disappointment in the end",cupid_shot_you,3 January 2021,1,"I have been watching (and trying to watch) Korean movies and TV in the past year and my biggest two issues with Korean style movie making are that they overdramatize the mundane and they make the police/authorities hilariously incompetent. Both of which (no surprise) showed up in this film. They spend so much on the emotional part of film making and none on realism.The ending - any half decent detective would have pieced it all together, including the cellar.The invitation - why would any sane house-sitter invite a total stranger into the house?Everything about this movie is frustrating, it's like watching 90s hollywood action flick. All emotions, no realism."
865,Academy gracefully anoints the rightful King...,luxnova-89167,10 February 2020,10,"I always respected Academy for their independence and the best professional group of critics in cinematography in the world. They didn't hesitate to award Parasite with 4 Oscars in the most important categories.I watched Parasite over and over again since Cannes award. The progression of the film storyline is amazing as every episode links each other seamlessly but with more deeper tensions.The intermission was when Mr. Park's family was away for camping. Director Bong probably wanted to provide the audiance a moment to enjoy, relax but with the thunderstorm the fatal second half deploys.This movie embraces all genre (I would call it neo-genre by Bong) and detailed beauty of the social diversity unfold to its extream.I have a habit of reading reviews before choosing films and especially I read most of the reviews just before the Oscars announcement. Most of the IMDB members left 8-10 (mostly 10) but after the awards, I can see unexplainable reviews 1 or 2 with non-sense. I know it's out of jealousy and lack of understanding for the Korean films. Hope you watch Parasite again and rethink..."
866,A realistic movie without being necessarily realistic,inesrvoliveira,20 February 2020,10,"The movie is very well planned, if the viewer isn't watching closely he or she may lose a few details that make this movie so great. The movie makes people feel every type of emocion and makes you understand different types of realities... I really recommend and better to watch it without any clue of what is about to happen."
867,the hype,dsohn7,4 March 2020,10,"I love Breaking Bad. I watched the entirety of it three times. But at the first go, it took getting to season 4, episode 11 (Crawl Space) for my mind to go numb from the intensity, and to season 5, episode 14 (Ozymandias) for it to crumble. That is how long it took me to understand the hype.Parasite did it in less than 2 hours."
868,Parasite,samjudd,18 February 2020,10,"Bong Joon Ho's chilling satirical masterpiece addresses the age old theme of social class. Much like Bong Joon Ho's previous work, Snowpiecer (2013), the question of why some people are seen as ""lower"" and some people are seen as ""higher"" class is asked. The film also explores what we have to sacrifice to change social classes under a capitalist system.
The narrative follows the Kims, a poor family who con their way into becoming the servants of a rich family, the Parks. Their easy life gets complicated when their deception is threatened with exposure. What follows is a fascinating spectacle which is sometimes operatic in nature and a sad reflection of modern life. Although it is all set in South Korea, the story works so well because it is universal and could have been set practically anywhere. It could be argued that there are no villains in the film, just people; however, it is anything but a soap opera. It is a commentary on the human condition. Nothing is black and white, just shades of grey.
Parasite offers a way of seeing the world which feels unlike anything most Western audiences have seen before. However, there are still some films which it does bear some stylistic similarities to. Hitchcock comes to mind with films such as Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963).
There is also a twist in the tail which does feel slightly Hitchcockian. I could also see traces of films with a more biblical and spiritual quality to them such as Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999).
The acting was convincing throughout with stand out performances from Kang-ho Song and Sun-kyun Lee which puts the audience on edge. The spider-like way Bong Joon Ho directed his cast to move added to the sense of uneasiness.
The writing is spot on with some razor sharp wit which, combined with the direction, made for some side-splitting moments. However as a contrast to the more humorous points in the film, there are moments of real sadness and pain. The contrasts beautifully represent life, because what is life if not a series of contrasts?"
869,Keeps you interested,lutmjr,2 February 2020,8,"This movie paints a picture of necessity. One family needs to survive, another to to thrive, and when the tempo clash, there will be casualties on both sides. Life goes on for both families, but it shows that the less fortunate are more prone to violence."
870,A very rewarding experience,therealpanita1,15 February 2020,9,"Love to see movies that are different than what comes out of USA studios, and this one was unique and fresh. After seeing it I have added Seoul as my next destination, it just will not happenduring rainy season. 🤣This film showed that life is not so different around the world. For example the way the rich folk in this film looked on the downtrodden folk; it reminded me of life in 1970s when I grew up in South America.Yes it merits the awards it received at the Oscars."
871,"Ethics, poverty, and suspense",bret-62066,27 April 2020,7,"I managed to not know much about this before watching. Was genuinely surprised by a few plot twists, and was at the edge of my seat or holding my breath for many moments, with many laughs at the believable absurdity in between. In the end, I felt this was a thought-provoking commentary on the desperation and feelings of being trapped experienced by many in poverty."
872,A great movie,armin-durakovic,12 February 2020,9,"I really liked the movie a lot. It is extraordinary.
The plot is a unique masterpiece. Like most Korean movies, it is maybe not for everyone's stomach. It is a brutal, honest and a raw dark comedy, which has a deeper meaning that progresses throughout the whole movie and punches you at the end with a knockout twist.
It replicates the cold and honest reality of the outside world of poor and rich differences. So, whoever wants to experience a thrilling push of harsh reality, packed into a metaphoric world of class diversity and the struggle between them, has to see this movie."
873,"Entertaining, but I didn't like the message",savethecloudsfoundation,15 December 2020,6,The one thing I got from this movie is that Bong Joon-ho must really hate rich people. This is even more obvious when you consider that his other notable film is basically about the same thing. Rich vs poor. This is a bit odd considering he has a net worth of 30 million dollars.This movie is about a poor family that lies and weasels their way into the service of a rich family. In doing so they not only screw over several people but also murder a few of them in the process. And yet at the end of the film we're supposed to feel that all of this is somehow justified.Or maybe we're not supposed to feel that it's justified because I sure didn't.Not really sure why it got so much praise. Could be because we are living in a time when the majority of movies being made are superheros or reboots. Thats basically the only thing this movie has going for it. It was entertaining and well made but I didn't like the ending at all.
874,Absurd lousy movie,geekerr,16 April 2020,1,Unbeleivable this crap won best picture Ghoulish gory cheap little slasher movie Pathetic the brilliant Marriage Story lost out to this sensationalist absurdity
875,A PERFECT STORY TELLING,raykuanlabel-291-473410,12 February 2020,9,"To link and tie the story together which starts as comedy - then to drama - and then thriller, and ends with crime seamlessly is simply phenomenal. The only reason why I gave it a 9 is I am not a fan of subtitles. It truly is top-notch brilliant filmmaking by Joon Ho. He deserves all the Oscars wins. Bravo!"
876,Hollywood only WISHES it produced films this good.,Avwillfan89,22 February 2020,10,"After watching this, I could not stop thinking about it for several days. After the second watch, I noticed several other easter eggs, hidden gems that neatly tied all of the themes together.THIS is how movies should be made. I had expected 1917 to win all the awards, but after seeing this, I knew this was the movie that should sweep this years Oscars.And finally, the Oscars got it right in choosing a foreign-language film as Best Picture winner. And it's not hard to see why. Despite it being set in South Korea, it incorporates universal themes such as poverty, trying whatever it takes to get your family a better life and class differences.Rightfully, they'll be talking about this film for decades."
877,Family Drama + Comedy + Thriller = Social Message,alessandronuel,28 June 2019,10,"From a thriller of Memories of Murder to a monster film of The Host, Bong Joon Ho could transform a family drama as entertaining as never before.Truly an unexpected, perfect, blend of genres to satirize class division and hypocrisy.Even the dialogue scenes are not tiresome, but intriguing and often hilarious.Well done Korean Cinema, proud of you!"
878,Film real than REAL,steve-81459,7 June 2019,10,"The Parasite shows Korean house architects that calls 'Banjiha'(lower level house). Because it appears only at Korea, I taught its mood for Korean, but all over the world liked it!."

880,"What a great movie, bravo",khizernawaz,14 August 2019,10,"What a great movie, bravo.. bong direct this movie up to the mark. fantastic"
881,Probably not something you have seen before - in a good way,harrylosborne,23 January 2021,7,"O What I enjoyed most about Parasite is the complete culture shock: from a ""Western"" perspective, very few people will have seen a film like this. The mannerisms of the cast (both the rich socialites and the lowly main characters) is unique to this film, along with the settings used throughout the movie. This not only delivers novel cinematography, but combined with this unique story, Parasite is worth watching for the experience alone. The acting is strong right through the story, with some excellent framing and shot shaping to emphasise certain points. By the end, you can see what got Bong Joon-ho nominated for all these awards - and you would have to agree, he probably deserved to win most of them too."
882,Parasite Film Review - Bong Joon Ho Directs An Oscar Winner That Trump Dismisses,helenbassett,22 February 2020,10,"Parasite won Best Film and Best Director for Bong Joon Ho at the Oscars this month, also winning International Feature Film and Original Screenplay. Neon the distributors suggested that Donald Trump, (leader of the free world) unsurprisingly didn't like it as he cannot read. Harsh. My only gripe with subtitles is I cannot always watch the screen action as I don't want to miss the words. You get used to them of course but like Pedro Almodovar's Pain And Glory I missed some of the beautiful designs. Caught that on demand prior to the Oscars as it wasn't available anywhere locally. But missing out on world cinema and tv because of subtitles is very sad.To be honest Paradise is a horrible film. With horrible characters living a horrible life. A black comedy, horror tragedy that reeks of the class divide between a successful South Korean family and their poor contemporaries. And the living conditions are startling, with the poor living in a basement with a window on a street that is regularly urinated in. Just in front of them. And piggy-backing off their upstairs neighbours internet connection. We take pleasure in laughing at their hovel while our wealthy family live in the most architecturally perfect modern home we all would imagine living in. Bravo to the Production designer Lee Ha-jun for realising this on a sound stage.So while our wealthy Park family smell of money, the poor Kim family smell of whatever you can imagine poverty and that bug infested basement smells of, and it isn't nice. Old radish our rich husband played by Sun-kyun Lee suggests. But things are finally looking up for the loving Kim family. Not with the pizza boxes they construct for minimum wage though. Instead son Ki-woo played by Woo-sik Choi is recommenced for a tutoring job with the wealthy Park family. His rich friend who currently tutors the young daughter wants to romance her when she goes to college. We can see where that might go.And for Ki-woo the Park family live in another world, as he climbs out of the basement. Mrs Park played by the lovely Yeo-jeong Jo goes about her day supported by terrific housekeeper Moon-gwang. To be honest Lee Jeong-eun keeps the house running as Mrs Park is a little on the ditzy side, but in awe of her young son's 'artistic' talents. He needs an art tutor for sure, and once saw a ghost she confides, although his sister sees right through him. But what are the chances that Mi-Woo knows of an art tutor, very in demand and just returned from Chicago I think. So So-dam Park's Ki-jeong also climbs out of the basement and spins the gullible Mrs Park a line of Google babble that wins her the job. Mrs Park even spins herself the lines as she accepts Ki-jeongs. Although the Park family are really lovely. But as these two chancers have managed to begin feathering their nest, they are actually good at what they are doing. And with the right opportunity both wasters could have aspired to the same roles, without the deception.But deception is what they do and Ki-jeong sees an opportunity for her Dad played by Kang-ho Song, to be the new driver to Mr Park. Her actions in getting him the role left a bad taste in my mouth. Getting her art tutor job didn't hurt anyone. But after a wash and brush up Mr Kim can actually drive, cornering without spilling a coffee in the hand of Mr Park. And now our three hustlers spy even more opportunity for Mum to get in on the action when Moon-gwang's peach allergy is discovered, and Mrs Kim's Hye-jin Jang is recruited as the new housekeeper. All the Park's money for staff now goes directly into the Kim's pockets.But with all the family out of the basement their smell has followed them. Something that the Park's son notices. All are perfectly capable of doing their jobs but with their bad odour they pollute the beautiful home. Where do they go from here then? How do they grab this beautiful life for themselves? Well one dark and stormy night the poor cross the line. The veneer of respectability can disappear in an instant and ghosts can materialise from basements long gone.But all actions have consequences as Bong Joon Ho directs the poor fighting over scraps from the table of the rich, when they could have shared instead. But why should they share the scraps we ask? If his first film was called Barking Dogs Never Bite, Parasite will show us that with enough antagonism they will. But I don't blame the Park family who gave employment to the poor to facilitate their comfortable lives. They are incapable without them. Each class living off the other.And there is no answer of course to the film's questions, only the international language of morse code desperation to decipher, and never be able to respond to."
883,An interesting and unusual film,movieguy-60101,18 December 2021,6,"This film has one of the best set ups in recent memory. The stealthy way in which these two families begin to mingle is really extraordinary.However, there is a turning point in the film in which the entire tone of the film charges. It become very dark and gruesome almost to a comical extreme. I'd be very interested to know if there has been external pressure on the director to push the film in a different direction."
884,It's a scam,omgfaleh,16 March 2021,2,One of the most overrated movies i've ever seen. The hype was for nothing and everything was predictable.
885,Awesome movie!,kurtizenhaaa,12 February 2020,10,"I loved this movie so much!
The film is interesting, thought provoking, there is drama, comedy and an impressive plot twist.
All my friends who watched it liked and so did I.
I watched the film in Korean with Brazilian Portuguese subtitles, I think it is important to watch the film in its own language.
Song Kang-ho is an excellent actor, I really liked his work. The first film I've watched with him was ""A Taxi Driver"" (2017), another awesome filme about some events of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980.
After watching Parasite, I was very inclined and interested in looking for other Bong Joon-ho's films."
886,The way of story telling is the soul of this master piece by Bong,prafullasrivastav,16 February 2020,9,"Performance: Both Kim and Park family members did brilliant job in their role. Kim family was full of cunning and witty one however Park family was simple and soft one. Both family depicted their side perfectly.Direction: Bong is the captain of this dark comedy with lots of thriller. Just like he baked dark comedy cinema as a cake and added thriller like a cherry on the top of the cake. Execution matters a lot when you are talking about top quality cinema and this is one of them.Script: This is the main USP of this movie. Although this movie available in the English subtitle, still you are able to relate and enjoy this cinema completely. Great showcase of the difference between elite class and poor people. Some small object played pivot role e.g. Smell, Morse CodeBackground Score: As movie flow, background score provided perfect combination to it. For this genre, great background score is key to entertain the audience.Last Words: Don't miss it otherwise isme tera ghata."
887,Masterpiece,pradeepcindidimple,16 February 2020,9,"The powerful plot throws up some brilliant twists that could never have been guessed upon. Parasite clearly portrayed what class division in a society. A brilliant masterpiece that deserves to be watched and felt upon!!
Highly recommended if you like korean movies."
888,Breaks the boundaries of just a movie,sperantez,17 February 2020,10,"Parasites are a social movie whose main theme is a discussion about poverty. In the main role, a family of poor people who get a job in the house of the rich. At first glance, it seems that the name ""Parasites"" obviously expresses the author's opinion about the main characters. But then you realize that the main characters are shown with great love, and the author would not like to call them guilty. But the rich family is not exposed as antagonists, they are naive, kind people, as much the main characters as the poor. It is not possible to call the third family parasites. Then who are the parasites? I would say that the parasites in this film - and this is what makes movies valuable to me-are rather States, social statuses. Poverty, as well as wealth, are parasites, they set boundaries, they deform people, and people are not really to blame, people by their nature do not seek evil, they are only victims.If we talk about the plot and the overall feeling of the picture - it is dynamic and interesting, the dialogues are cute, the plot is constantly developing and growing, and resembles Kafka, in the sense of growing and growing absurdity. In General, the film is a Comedy, it is easy to watch, through the whole picture there is a light humor and irony, from this the ending becomes surreal - it is even more felt that all the characters are victims.Also in the film there is an extremely pleasant and easy symbolism. Very interesting is accompanied by the movement of the plot and characters of the symbol of water, which at one point becomes a flow, a symbol of the smell, which becomes smell, the use of characters for foreign words, the idea of ""plan"", which gradually develops one of the characters, the stone that brings wealth and relationship of the hero with him. This gives room for intellectual play and a more complete immersion in the picture and situation.It is impossible not to say that the film is damn beautiful and flawlessly shot. I would like to say something about dialogues - sometimes they are so vital and interesting that it takes your breath away. I liked the ending very much, apparently the author still comes to the sad conclusion that no matter what, poverty can not be overcome, you can not cross the boundaries that the characters are trying to break.10 out of 10"
889,Exceptional,krystielovestrevor,15 February 2020,10,"This is the first and only movie I've felt compelled to write a review for.Admittedly, I rarely watch foreign language films because of having to read subtitles, but I made a point this year of watching every Oscar-nominated film I could. I had absolutely no idea what to expect going into it, and I think that's what made the film so compelling. Absolutely exceptional acting, beautiful cinematography, moving symbolism and pertinent social commentary. I could never predict what would happen next in the plot, and just when you think it should go one way, it does a 180 and goes a completely unexpected direction.Go into it knowing as little as possible about it. It's so much better that way. You won't regret it."
890,Things as they are,jotapalta,16 February 2020,10,"Some people say that this movie is ""disgusting"", thats because actually it is: social inequality unveiled, disgusting and unpleasant as it is.
Who are the parasites?"
891,"Good movie, but highly overrated !",fernfilms-892-271775,16 September 2020,7,"The movie is pretty engaging and great performances by the actors, but all the drama before the oscars etc and hyesteria around this film was definitely unnecessary!You won't be disappointed watching it.
Again, highly overrated."
892,Film of the Year,slmn-114-251365,16 February 2020,10,"In this movie Bong Joon-ho directs like Billy Wilder plus Alfred Hitchcock... the result is just unique. The plot is not only original but contemporary, funny, scary and poetic at the same time.
Remarkable."
893,Good movie but why the hype,bilbobaggins-50638,13 May 2020,7,"The story was really good and enjoyable but, it was kinda a let down knowing how much people hyped this movie. It won so many awards but why. It was not that shocking at all. But the best part about it was the acting and cinematography.If you want to watch a really crazy mind blowing movie you should watch Old Boy. It's another Korean film that deserved more praise than this movie."
894,Dreadful,robertpatrickmadden,12 July 2020,1,Don't believe the hype. This is a crass pretentious movie pretending to be a serious story about class struggle. It's obviously made by luvvies in the Korean film industry clique. The ending proves this theory.
895,An Absolute Must See!,kimknutsen,16 February 2020,10,"A timeless Masterpiece, a review wouldn't do this film proper justice, just go watch it.
Well deserving of its four oscars in Best Picture, Directing, International Feature Film and Writing (Original Screenplay). Still i am a bit dissapointed that non of the cast was even nominated for acting. All around gripping and mesmerizing preformances & plot."
896,South Korean masterpiece,habibjedly,16 February 2020,10,"This work is one of the greatest films that I have seen ... Indeed, it is a masterpiece in the fullest sense of the word in terms of direction, which was a professional of all professionalism or the method of sequencing events that were easy for the viewer and makes him coordinate with the events without even feeling ... more on that The performance of the actors that was so great that you feel that you are involved with them in the events or rather merge with it ... The bottom line is this movie is creativity creativity creativity"
897,Caution: deeply unsettling,trietsch-95508,17 February 2020,10,"To be honest, normally, I do not fancy such type of movies, especially asian movies, this one, well, it nearly kills you. It starts somehow slow, even boring, maybe a touch of comedy, but then, then the second half of it is just a nightmare focusing on society and it's negative aspects. This movie kept me awake for many hours at night and will always remind me of so many things like to be thankful for what you have and how to approach others. Check out yourself. For sure, one of the true oscar winners! Fully deserved!"
898,Absolute Masterpiece,haotinhle,16 February 2020,10,"It's one of the greatest films I've ever watched in my life. Truly a masterpiece. It was so captivating and an emotional roller coaster. It's an absolute must see!! It deserved every award it got and I'm so proud to see it win 4 oscars. Truly deserved and more. Bong joon ho created one of the most creative, unique, amazing films I've seen."
899,ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE,davidjunderwood,20 February 2020,10,"I just watched ""Parasite"" for the first time. It is currently February and I watched the film for the first time around Thanksgiving. I loved it back then and I love it even more now. Definitely is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES.
This movies plot is absolutely insane but that is not the important part of the movie. It is really a story about trying to move up in the world and how that's an impossibility. And that even the hope can destroy you.
The movie is thrilling, beautifully directed, heart felt, etc.. Also, from a re-watch point of view you pick up many new points of analysis and get to notice how beautifully edited this movie is.
I want to write more but that would get into spoilers and you would stop reading. But watching this movie is a NECESSITY."
900,Brilliant ! ... like 2 hours of BBC inside no. 9 series,mmorrow2012,12 February 2020,10,"I'm sure I'm not the only one to see the similarities - which is not meant as a negative comment in any way ... if anything I hope it leads to an Inside no. 9 film - that said - I seem to remember the League of Gentlemen film being a bit crap even though I loved the TV series.Parasite keeps you interested from start to finish with great comedy, great characters, great twists & turns, great cinematography during the flood sequences and I especially enjoyed seeing the contrast between living standards in South Korea.So many good things to enjoy like the impression of a North Korean news anchor, dark humour. My favourite character was probably the father but I loved them all for different reasons.Definitely going to seek out more Asian films now."
901,Nice movie,kiokas,13 February 2021,7,"Definitely a nice movie to watch. Extreme and unreal situations with scenes that will keep you on your toes. Funny at times and dramatic at others. Acting was very good and the characters were played very well. I don't thing its a movie that you would watch again though, thus 7."
902,My kind of tea for an amazing film~,DrunkenSoju,27 June 2019,9,"This film was incredibly well shot and thought out! It had basically everything to have in a drama thriller film. Its my first Joon-ho Bong film and my god it was perfect! I love drama, I love thriller and crime. It hit the perfect spot for my liking and the story was perfect and emotional throughout! The awards given to this film were well deserved and after watching the film I can see why. I think I have became a fan of Mr. Bong's films and im off to watch his other hits!"
903,"""The Parasite Case""",cgcastanedo-75966,8 April 2020,7,"With a light comedy tone and a very insightful vision, Bong Joon Ho begins an agile story about social classes, their differences and paradoxically their similarities, with great sharpness he also analyzes the legitimate aspirations of social promotion... But at what price?
From this thesis, many themes and subtopics emerge: simulation, lies, threats, which lead to stronger ones: revenge, hatred.
Bong Joon Ho brings such control of his film that he even turns technologies (cellular) into one more protagonist, who will always be present throughout its history.
So far so good, but the climax of ""Parasite"" its conclusion and its end depart from its very interesting beginning, the director seems to want to change now the tone of his comedy towards drama and / or terror, only to end up losing control of his narrative with a grotesque denouement.
Consequently the film reduces its intensity and interest with which it started, becoming confusing and anticlimactic.
""A case of parasitosis that quickly went viral and spread to Hollywood itself, who began to distribute prizes...""
Casting includes Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park. Sarcastic sequence of the confrontation with the old housekeeper, who uses the cell phone to threaten, as if it were a weapon."
904,Overrated movie,villarms,13 January 2020,1,"It makes no sense of the situations. Some scenes were good but the movie is too long for the story. Also, the plot is very predecible in a lot of things.
I don't recommend this movie."
905,A craft masterclass by a genius,danielnikrasov,4 August 2019,10,"I watched Parasite twice at the 36th Annual JFF (Jerusalem Film Festival) and I have to say, the film is still in my head. The genre of the film is absolutely different from other Hollywood's franchises, trust me (Bong Joon-ho was right!).This review doesn't contain spoilers (although I do recommend to not read this before you watch the film).""Parasite"", directed by a an artist himself Bong Joon-ho, is a social satire comedy-tragedy film that, like the film ""Us,"" tells of two families of different status, one of whom lives in the basement apartment and in unemployment condition. Each member of the poor family plans to sneak into a wealthy family's estate until they are exposed to unexpected twists.The film won the Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival and the Sydney Film Festival at the Sydney Film Festival, and in fact, it deserved and won these awards (Eat Straw, Pulp Fiction). Why? Now comes the twist.On the one hand, Bong uses a very creative black comedy, as I will describe below, to improve stories of inequality, economic imbalance, inherent corruption and power abuse that reflect South Korean society's view. And on the other hand, all seven Bong films cover the genres, from science fiction to police proceduralism to the small-town murder mystery, but they all have many things in common. Such as: in the films ""Mother"" and ""Memories of Murder,"" Bong uses his films to reflect the problematic establishment of Korea, South Korea in particular, and the perfect results. As mentioned, this film is ignored by the genre's conventions: it's soft and cruel; Beautiful and hard; Beautiful and tragic and a masterpiece in her classroom investigation.The screenwriters, Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin Won, use a lot of twisted sleeves in the plot to make the movie more entertaining this year. Each line is delivered smoothly, as if these characters seem to be real people living in this story, with Jung Jaeli's classic score playing tremendously in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo distinguishes itself from a more realistic grainy style in the basement apartment, to a smoother style when focusing on our rich characters. This point of view causes us to look at two very opposing groups of people differently to make it even clearer that they do not belong to the same world. The classroom systems did not look earthy but still perfect before.Bong makes sure to simplify the lines between the two sides at certain points and cause your sympathy to jump back and forth with hectic consequences. It is a film that focuses on poverty, despair and what we are willing to do to take what needs to be ours. The tension between supreme elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face. Therefore, Bong likes to blur the lines of the genre and he makes sure he hits every step in the stairwell to succeed.""Parasite"" is a craft masterclass in which the power of the story lies in the way comedy and drama rub off on each other in the proper way to ignite a bit of thriller that turns into pure horror when despair and hatred meet each other. This is also not a film that built on one plot twist at the end, it's completely different from any Hollywood film that makes viewers angry at the viewer who just finished watching and suspecting him. This film will be remembered in the history books of world cinema, and foreign cinema in particular as one of the most creative films of the year in general. If not, then Hollywood is completely out of control."
906,powerful depiction of class struggle,rtlk-26762,27 September 2024,9,"A haunting movie, Parasite depicts a poor working family who gets involved with a well-to-do family by working for them, and more.Details of the working family's life make the film nuanced - where the daughter goes for a bit of freedom, how the son hopes to escape his poverty - especially when a classmate recommends him for a tutoring job. The family pools its energies to survive.Then there are the attitudes of the wealthy family and their lifestyle. Their shiny house.I walked out of the movie theater saying ""Wow"" repeatedly because I was so impressed. I'm now a complete fan of Bong Joon Ho."
907,I'll come back,garciaroscojose,11 September 2023,9,"This film seems like all those I've seen at home without even wanting to watch a movie, it's so good, it catches you.And I love it.From the beginning to the end of it, we can see how clever this production is, how smooth, how well intended... I love that it doesn't threaten itself as a cult film by wanting to be a very serious film (even though it is) and leaving space for regular conversations between characters. Not everything in a movie must be relevant to the plot, sometimes we just want a long or short walk in the universe of the film, and that's ok too!I want to thank the director for it, I love this style."
908,Brilliant film,christyperren,23 September 2024,9,"Parasite is one of those films that completely flips your expectations in the best way possible. At first, it feels like a dark comedy about a poor family scheming their way into a rich household, but then it shifts into something much deeper and darker. Bong Joon-ho does an incredible job of blending genres-you'll be laughing one minute and then sitting on the edge of your seat the next. The whole cast is flawless, but Song Kang-ho really stands out as the father who's caught between two worlds. What's amazing is how Parasite tackles huge themes like class, privilege, and inequality without ever feeling preachy. Every scene is layered with meaning, and there's this constant tension building throughout. The way it all comes together in the end is just... wow. It's the kind of movie that stays with you, making you think about the society we live in and the invisible barriers that divide us. Honestly, it's one of the most brilliant films I've seen in a long time-an absolute must-watch."
909,"""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan.""",gettodamoofies,21 August 2024,9,"FOLM: 9.0
Rewatching Parasite reminds me why this film made such a global splash. Even though it's a Korean film, the themes hit universally, so it's no surprise it took home Best Picture at the Oscars. There's a sharpness to how it explores class divides and human nature that feels both raw and relatable, no matter where you're from.What strikes me again is just how spot-on everything is-from the casting to the writing to the direction. Each performance is layered and feels lived-in, with every actor bringing out the subtleties of their character's motivations. I find myself really appreciating the way Bong Joon-ho pulls it all together, balancing tension, drama, and satire so seamlessly. It's a masterclass in storytelling, no doubt.However, there's one aspect that still doesn't quite click with me: the comedy. For all its brilliance, the humour feels a bit off and manufactured at times, pulling me out of the film's world. I know it's part of Bong's signature style, but it doesn't land as naturally as the rest of the film's elements. Maybe it's because I've become more familiar with his approach, so what might have felt groundbreaking for others comes across as more expected to me.That's not to say it's not an amazingly good film-it absolutely is. But having watched Shoplifters from 2018, which touches on some similar themes, Parasite feels slightly less fresh to me. It's still a powerhouse of a film, just not quite the 10/10 that others might find it to be.Even with that minor gripe, Parasite remains a compelling watch. It's visually striking, tightly constructed, and full of moments that stick with me long after the credits roll. For anyone who hasn't seen it-or even those revisiting-it's a damned good film that more than earns its place as a modern classic.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.5

910,A Masterful Commentary Of The Rich and Poor,FilmFinatic062817,25 November 2023,10,"I'm going to start this film review by saying that this film was amazing in so many different ways, so many different aspects really shone, from the; cinematography, acting, pacing in the narrative, etc, it was really a very impressive film, overall. I really do wish I had watched this film earlier, however I do think I am going to rewatch this film to just really understand the depth and layers of the different characters, the different aspects of the narrative, and the duality in the cinematography between the rich and the poor.Firstly I wanted to talk about the beautiful visual aspects of this film, as since it is a film that isn't in English, and non English speaking films, in the past, have tended to find it hard to gain traction. So the visual storytelling was something that needed to be able to explore and explain the story. The cinematography is subtle and effortless; in its use of focus, framing and composition, color palette, as well as its ability to create a duality in the poor and rich areas. There were some really amazing shots that never felt out of place for the tone it was setting throughout the film, they felt dynamic, varied, and was generally very effective in its visual storytelling. As I mentioned before, there is a visual duality in the houses of the two families, this film utilized the two differing environments to its fullest potential, further accentuating the differences. The rich family's house had nature, open spaces, and was above the ground, which can't be said for the poor family's home which was urban, tight, and half underground with their natural sunlight coming from a window that is privy to drunk people. I also couldn't help but notice that the rich house was more intense in its brightness, and as we as the audience followed our protagonists into the poor area we descended more into the darkness, which is quite astounding and this film is full of these visual storytelling techniques adding to the beauty of it...I love films like these where the stories are compact and every single shot, that makes a sequence, that makes a scene, has meaning and adds to the narrative, pushing it forward. The beginning of the film sets up everything that the story relies and builds upon; the poorer family lives in the underground of society where they are almost left to rot and perish, scrounging for anything they can get their hands on, as opposed to the rich family who live very comfortably, with not a care in the world, oblivious and disgusted by the poor, who, to them, are a completely different species. As the film title implies, the poor family becomes the parasite sucking everything they can out of the rich family, but it turns out there is already a parasite present, which creates that conflict and makes for an amazing story. Seeing these 2 'parasites' fight for their host is so interesting as it explores the vast difference in the mindset of the 2 families, the poorer one showcasing their desperation for this life that the richer family lives so obliviously.There was some excellent acting in this film, the cast was brilliant, I thought that they didn't just play, but they actually embodied those characters. The actress who played the mother of the rich household, Cho Yeo-Jeong, I thought was amazing. That oblivious nature of the rich is perfectly embodied by her. Another performance that I thought really stood out was the performance of Choi Woo-Sik, who played Ki Woo, the son of the poor family. I thought he brought his character through a nice arc throughout the film. In a lot of the scenes he was in, his character's thought processes were subtle yet obvious enough for the audience to acknowledge, which was very nice to see. Those two performances stood out to me but that's not to say the rest of the cast was less, they were amazing..."
911,Not Oscar worthy - but better than the other nominees,joshybrown-27184,8 April 2020,6,"So far I've watch Jo Jo Rabbit, Joker, The Irishman, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, and Parasite. Parasite deserves the win because it's only out of those movies(plus a few I haven't seen yet) but that's grading on a curve. It's not a great film. It's cliche and has some bizarre plot lines that are interjected as a way out of obvious plot holes (plus some cheap entertainment value). Curiously absent from the Oscar nominations was Uncut Gems which I found to be more entertaining and powerful than Parasite and the others(almost passed over watching that one but decided to give it a go because Adam Sandler hasn't been funny in 15 years anyway so let's see him in a drama - he was brilliant)."
912,Wealth corrupts,ESHSfilmclub,23 November 2023,9,"Parasite, dark and satirical, reflects society's corruption in class struggle. The films follow a struggling family, the Kims, and their climb to fortune through working for a wealthy family, the Parks. Bong Joon-ho et al.'s fastidious composition of every frame, consistent symbolism, and contrasting color grading leave no doubt as to how Parasite garnered the 2020 Academy Awards for Best Picture, and several other nominations and wins. The film's ending, fresh and unexpected, never felt out of place as the subtleties of carefully placed details throughout the film foreshadow the ending's twist. The gifted stone, speculated to bring wealth, only brought corruption and misfortune; The bright red sauce splashed onto pizza foreshadowed the fatal consequences of the schemes crafted; The line that must never be crossed- except when one character does, all subconsciously produced the perfect atmosphere of the foreboding implication of something terrible to come.The contrast of the darkness of the Kim's downstairs world to the Park's airy, bright, and naturally lit atmosphere forces the audience to reflect on their interpretation of class. As we watch the endings of each character, we have to wonder if they got what they deserved. How we feel about them forces us to confront our values- to many, this led to the feeling of discomfort and that the film was too 'odd'. The constant artificial lighting and dark grading of the downstairs world remind us of the Kim's goals to worm their way up in search of light. As Joon-ho's morally gray characters climb up the stairs or driveway, they reflect the inherent societal desires for wealth and the strive to achieve it. Joon-ho uses separate upstairs and downstairs worlds to supplement the film's message rather than to become the premise of it. This allows a fresher and freer interpretation of class struggle rather than recycling through past examples of this familiar piece of symbolism for class struggle. The character's journey of climbing up becomes another one of the film's several subtleties."
913,It's not as good as publicity,k-48873,16 May 2020,7,"This movie feels so-so, far from boasting so good, or I give too great expectations, the result is too big, the plot is too ordinary, and many people hold this film to the altar"
914,leaves me with just hollow emptiness,keenast,23 January 2020,1,"Everybody and his aunts seem to love this movie - and I can't figure out why. Yes, it's technically well done but so what, many movies are well done. There is not on character of interest to me and nothing makes sense to me."
915,Interesting look into Korean society.,jim-man,18 December 2020,8,"Like everywhere else, there are the successful and the not-so. In this film, the bottom dwellers (the Kim family) live in a basement suite and do odd jobs. One day, they use a scam to infiltrate a rich family (the Park family).In typical Asian manner, the employers don't check job references or do a criminal background check. Depending on personal introductions and a superficial assessment at the job interview. Such is the dependence on the sanctity of Confucian social relationships.Naturally, the amoral Yi family take full advantage of the naive gentile Mrs. Park. Behaving in an atypical Asian way to eliminate the other servants.Add the complication of a debtor hiding in a secret basement. Preferring self-imprisonment to life as an outcast above ground.Eventually, there is tragedy as the past of the deceitful people catch up with them. Bringing death to the Park family.Excellent direction and acting. Quite convincing.Like the film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, this film offers insights into Confucian society. About ideals and the failures to meet the standards."
916,A Sharp Social Satire Wrapped in Thrilling Suspense and Dark Comedy,divaarmedio,27 September 2024,10,"*Parasite* (*Gisaengchung*, 2019), directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a masterful, genre-bending film that explores themes of class disparity, greed, and survival. The film follows the impoverished Kim family as they scheme their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family, with each member posing as a highly qualified professional. What begins as a darkly comedic take on social mobility soon escalates into a tense, unpredictable thriller.Bong Joon-ho's direction is brilliant, seamlessly blending social commentary with gripping suspense, dark humor, and shocking twists. The film's tone shifts effortlessly between comedy, drama, and horror, keeping the audience engaged and on edge. The intricate, layered screenplay, co-written by Bong, delves into the growing divide between the rich and the poor, examining the absurdities and brutal realities of class conflict in modern society.The performances are outstanding, with each member of the Kim and Park families playing their roles to perfection. Song Kang-ho, a frequent collaborator with Bong, delivers a standout performance as Kim Ki-taek, the patriarch of the Kim family. His portrayal of a man both desperate and cunning, trapped in a cycle of poverty, is poignant and powerful.The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is another highlight, with the stark contrast between the cramped, dingy basement where the Kim family lives and the sleek, modern luxury of the Park family's home visually reinforcing the class divide. The design of the Park house, with its large windows and clean lines, plays a crucial role in building suspense and tension as the story unfolds.*Parasite* is full of symbolism and metaphors, from the ""staircases"" that represent social hierarchy to the basement that becomes a literal underworld of hidden secrets. The film's title itself reflects the parasitic relationship between the families, as each feeds off the other in different ways, but also comments on the broader systemic inequalities in society.The film's climactic twist and its devastating final act are shocking and leave a lasting impression. Bong Joon-ho skillfully combines moments of brutal violence with emotional depth, creating a conclusion that is as tragic as it is thought-provoking.Overall, *Parasite* is a near-perfect film that transcends genre and cultural barriers. It is a searing critique of inequality, told with biting wit, suspense, and a remarkable attention to detail. Its historic win at the 2020 Oscars, where it became the first non-English language film to win Best Picture, solidified its place as one of the most important and influential films of the decade."
917,SUCH A GREAT THRILLER!!,snperera,19 January 2021,8,This family is so entertaining and real and the story is so so real and engaging and it has such a strong message about status and class!!! I really enjoyed it!!!
918,The other face of reality,greciarodarte,25 February 2020,8,"Parasite is a movie that has been recognized and given really good reviews, anyways to me it wasn't the best movie ever. This movie was different in the sense that it played with your mind having a story unpredictable. Parasite is also a reflect of society, our worst fear is ourselves and the system we have constructed. We are always trying to get more and more and sometimes we aren't able to see the risks until you loose it all. That's why I liked all the outcome that reflects what our reality is, anyways the result of all the problems was something not really convincing to me. The possibilities to get to that end are one in one million, so I think even a better ending would be too keep this real idea that things not always end up as we want. The movie in general was really well made, the way Bong Joon Ho thought about every scene and detail is surprising."
919,An Epic Interesting Film,alindsayal,12 December 2021,10,"This is a film that has been in the news lately as it picked up 4 Oscars including Best Director & Best Picture which is huge for a non english speaking film. I have now had the chance to see the film and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a poor family look to gain an opportunity by gaining jobs in a higher class family and gain the advantages from that.Main Character
Now there are quite a few characters in this film but really Woo-Sik Choi plays the son in the family and he does a great job in the film, you can see he has pretty honest intentions at first but things start to unravel for him and he doesn't quite know what to do. He is likeable but you aren't sure if you should root for him and that creates a multi layered character that keeps you interested throughout.Supporting Characters
Everybody gives a superb performance in the film, I won't go through everybody's names as they are quite long but whether it is the poor family or the rich family everybody is believeable and real in the film. These characters are as mentioned before multi layered and you just aren't exactly sure who exactly to root for. The one actor I will mention is Kang-Ho Song as the Father of the poor family, he is truly brilliant in this film, he probably goes through the most in this film and he is the most interesting person in this film and honestly he should have probably got nominated for the Best Supporting Actor at The Oscars but nonetheless he is great in this film.Story
The first 20 minutes of this film I wasn't exactly sure where this film was going but it is super fascinating watching the dynamics between the two families and seeing the different personalities and motivations which really blurs the line. I don't want to go into the plot too much as I had no idea what this film was about before I watched it so it should be the same for you. Also to put it on top the ending for this movie is so thought provoking and perfect for the film that has been going on.Script
The script even though in Korean is brilliant, this film suprisingly has tons of humour in it, I laughed quite a bit in this film which shows just how well the writing is to make these characters feel multi dimensional. The drama also really works to make you truly care about what is going on and what is happening to the characters that you are watching.Style
First of all lets mention that obviously this film has subtitles, this should not be something to worry about as it is fine and the film is so strong that it doesn't matter. Okay this film has a bit of everything in a stylistic way, it looks great and has bits of comedy, thriller, drama & horror, it is a perfect blend that keeps you on the edge of your seat and excited to see what comes next.Overall
Overall, this is one of the best films I have seen in the last few years, it just has a bit of everything to it and was well worthy of its Best Picture win at the Oscars. If you are put off by foreign films and reading subtitles, don't be as this is a truly special film that has to be seen to truly appreciate just how good it really is.Rating - 10/10."
920,"Breathtaking, Extraordinary and UNIQUE!!",rasoolyfarhad,5 March 2022,10,"A movie demonstrating different classes in society, accompanied with great acting, an original plot and beautiful cinematography, if you want a movie that you can find new things and hidden meanings everytime you rewatch, Parasite is THE movie you want, certainly one of the best movies of last decade and completely deserved all single awards it won."
921,Good film,pradyumnsaraswat,28 April 2020,7,"In my view it is neither too good nor too bad
But somwhere in middle"
922,It was so unexpected,greeneyekhajiit,28 June 2021,10,"It was so unpredictable, such a twist, so off the rails into the stratosphere, it's just - wow. Utterly a roller-coaster.I never would have expected something like this from a Korean movie - it's just not how they usually feel to me, it's more something like Seth MacFarlane does in his Family Guy or American Dad.It's serious, meaningful, so alive, and so tragic, so heart-breaking and so terrifying. And in the same time kinda light and funny. It never an overdose of either emotion, it's just enough to enjoy their somewhat sharp sensation. I just usually like those things, and this one is perfectly done, perfectly balanced, spiced and fresh."
923,Decent movie but does not live up to the hype,marc-van-duijn,9 March 2020,7,"I had high expectations given the raving reviews here. But I have to say, I was disappointed. Fair enough, it is a decent movie with an original plot, but certainly not one of the best films of all time. Not by a long shot."
924,Disappointed,bryan-16440,23 February 2020,1,After all the hype about this film and the number of awards I was very left feeling very disappointed with this film. Whilst it may have achieved what it set out to be. It seemed neither one thing nor the other. For the most part I found it completely predictable.
925,Parasite,msnakeairsoft,28 January 2022,10,"Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won's multi tonal script, it's a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul."
926,Ironic psycho,avarageBCSenjoyer,31 October 2021,9,"Ki-woo being crippled by something that really started this movie is very ironic and sad at the same time. Something that really excited me in this movie is the cinematography and the turning point of this movie - from the funny joke to the absolute psycho mode. Can't get enough of the idea of this movie, how everyone from success ended up being that one they were trying to get rid off. This movie comes-off like a great art with absurd soundtrack that still sounds good. This movie is near 10, it could be more artistic from the cinematography point, but still a must-watch."
927,"Great Plot, Great movie, but certainly not the greatest of the decade.",benjivenji,16 June 2020,8,"It was a really great and funny movie, but really predictable which makes it hard to say if it really is one of the greatest. Of course, it was funny, creative and overall just good.
Highly recommend if you're into Mr Bean/Charlie Chaplin comedy"
928,The best film of the 21st century,iwoegill-89023,19 October 2021,10,"Parasite (2019) is a masterpiece at it´s finest. There is clearly no surprise that it won 4 Academy Awards.My favorite part of the film was 100% the cinemaphotography, this movie is art, and that's thanks to the cinemaphotography. Every angle isn´t lazy. It´s well made and the director Bong Joon Ho took every chance possible to put his vision on the big screen.Another amazing thing is the acting. The actors put the best performance possible. From dramatic scenes, to intense scenes and to horror scenes.Now some people might not like the ending, but it had me amazed. It shows also how unpredictable this film is.It also shows how everyone isn´t who they say they are. Even if its just small things.This film is amazing and if you haven´t seen it, then I highly recommend it. (unless you cant handle violence) if not, then watch it."
929,"Parasite (2019): So Engaging That You Won't Want to Get Up, with Twists That Leave You Stunned",DJPleum,5 October 2024,10,"Parasite is a film that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time! Director Bong Joon-ho did an amazing job. The story revolves around the Kim family, who are extremely poor and desperate to infiltrate the wealthy Park family, which represents everything they aspire to be.It starts off with humor and charm, making us laugh at the Kim family's antics. But as the story progresses, it becomes clear that ""hey, this isn't just a comedy anymore."" The tension builds steadily, keeping me glued to my seat.What makes Parasite so fascinating is its unexpected twists. The film cleverly plays with the audience's expectations. In the beginning, we see the Kim family's struggle to integrate into the wealthy society they want to join, but as the story unfolds, everything takes a turn in a direction we never saw coming!There's a shocking scene where we uncover a secret hidden within the Park family's home that completely changes the game. I can't describe the feeling well enough; it felt like I was on a roller coaster!The actors in this film are fantastic! Especially Lee Sun-kyun and Choi Woo-shik, who bring depth to their characters, allowing us to understand where they come from and what they desire. The intelligent direction and beautiful cinematography enhance the film's allure. Parasite is not just a comedy or a mystery; it's also a reflection of societal issues that occur around us, cleverly using various symbols.Overall, Parasite is a must-see film! It's both entertaining and thought-provoking, making us question the world around us at the same time. If you haven't seen it yet, go find it and watch it right away!"
930,Parasite new century,nadia999,15 November 2023,9,"Parasite is a cinematic marvel that goes beyond mere storytelling to deliver a deeply resonating commentary on the class disparities that pervade modern society. Directed by the brilliantly inventive Bong Joon Ho, the film effectively intertwines elements of drama, comedy, and thriller to create an experience that lingers long after the screen goes dark.The narrative centers on two contrasting families and, through them, explores the complex dynamics of wealth, poverty, and human tendency. It's a masterly crafted web of intrigue that keeps the viewer engrossed and constantly on edge. The screenplay is astoundingly unpredictable and the sharp, crisp dialogue effectively builds tension while maintaining its dark humor.The cast delivers stellar performances that bring their layered characters to life. Each actor stands out, portraying their varied characters with precision, be it the cunning yet charismatic poor family or the oblivious yet complicated wealthy family. The somber, atmospheric cinematography coupled with the haunting score creates an increasingly uneasy ambiance that height."
931,Gave it a 7 but because of wokeness I dropped it to 6,mkwoolley,2 February 2021,6,The wokeness I am referring to is Hollywood. Best picture? Because it's a foreign film written by non white males and no white males are in the movie. This is a nice way to cap off the decade of insane wokeness. That is the only conclusion I can come to as to why this won so many Oscars (which have been a joke ever since Shakespeare in Love beat Saving Private Ryan for best picture).
932,"No one is ""evil"". Then how come the bad things happen?",jehpark,13 March 2020,10,"No one is ""evil"". Then how come the bad things happen?This cinema does not answer, but masterfully poses all the questions that should be asked. Interestingly enough, just like the characters do in the movie, Bong Joon Ho does not allow the audience a moment to think about the grand theme of the movie until the very end: What went wrong?It's funny, original, thrilling, and universal.
It's a movie to watch thoughtlessly with a can of beer.
It's a movie you could sit down and study the metaphors for hours.Parasite suggests a new paradigm for understanding our society, and most importantly, the people inside it."
933,It kept me interested but not really worth the high rating in my opinion.,Swe3ets,17 April 2020,7,"I felt there was a lot of unused themes, like the Chekhov's gun principle and the family was fairly smart but jobless, it doesn't fit. More goofy than a masterpiece.
All in all it was a decent movie and worth my time, I think its rating though is inflated by the social class messages throughout the movie."
934,A little confused as to how this movie is so extolled worldwide.,jasonjason-33756,7 August 2019,4,"I would like to start out by saying that I am a Korean-American college student (studying at an American college) and have plenty of experience watching Korean movies, including some great ones by Bong Jun-Ho himself, such as The Host, Memories of Murder, and more.A few months ago when the trailer for Gisaengchung (Parasite) came out, I was really hooked; the trailer gave off that eerie vibe (remotely reminded me of Midsommar by Ari Aster) which I found really intriguing. Seeing all the positive reviews on multiple websites, hearing that this film won at the Cannes Festival and understanding the genius of Bong from his previous films, I had very high expectations.Here are some of my main points to why I don't love this movie:1. Acting: The first 10~15 minutes were rather painful to watch. Perhaps it would hit differently for foreigners watching with subtitles, but the unnatural lines and the poor delivery made it really hard for me to focus on the characters. I think the poor acting performance gets better throughout the film, but the Jo Yeo-Jung (mother of rich family)'s acting just felt too out of place and cringey. Perhaps that was the point: to make it look awkward and artificial (especially with the sprinkling of English words) to poke fun at the rich class and their pretentiousness. I understand this is social satire, but the execution was not very convincing. If done properly, I feel like it could and should be subtle yet piercing. I would have had to hated her guts, wanting her to die or her close people to die, but I was barely filled with such emotions. She treats her maid a little too well, and her tone just isn't all that condescending or demeaning. Seemed more like a typical Korean woman freakishly obsessed with her children's education; not a greedy, disgusting woman who doesn't deserve her wealth and privilege.2. Poorly written/Predictable Plot: I don't the writers tried too hard writing the script for this movie, especially in the beginning where Park Seo-Jun (the tall, smart dude who used to teach Ki-Jung, the daughter of rich family) refers Ki-Woo (son of poor family) as a private tutor. Ki-Woo seemed too smooth with it (not to mention their entire family) even though it is implied that he has never done this before (in the scene where he drinks with Park, the ex-tutor). The film makes it seem like Ki-Woo and their entire family are expert con-artists who screwed up rich families all their lives. That transition was just too abrupt and unconvincing with very little build up.Now I want to talk about my main point, and perhaps my main pet peeve about this film: predictability. The element of surprise and keeping the audience at the edge of their seats is what drives us crazy and get excited: questioning every scene, line, action of the characters.However, many aspects of the movie were predictable. I felt like I was always two to three pages ahead of the script throughout the movie: how Ki-Woo will soon bring in her sister after getting the job and thus bring in the entire family; how the rich family will soon return from their camping trip due to the thunderstorm, to screw up the poor family that threw a party in the mansion-ish house. I also do not understand how the sex scene on top of Ki-Tae (dad of poor family) and his kids hiding under the table contributed to the plot. I wish they focused more on the class struggle, the main theme of this movie, and develop on that. The rich dad is the guy who is remotely the obnoxious, successful man who disdainfully looks down upon the poor (bc of his hate for Ki-Tae's smell, which is later the reason Ki-Tae kills the rich dad), but I feel like they could have painted him with a more obnoxious, cunning, and elitist personality. I didn't want or need the rich guy to die at the end, meaning that I wasn't in Ki-Tae's shoes as much as I wanted to and was supposed to, due to lack of character development and build-up.3. Execution: The theme of this movie is banal; but that doesn't matter because I believe execution and delivery are essential elements in story-telling. To bring up Breaking Bad, as much of a masterpiece it is, the plot, although extremely well executed and developed, isn't all THAT ground-breaking. A poor, depressed guy turning the tables around (rather dramatically) is a recurring theme in movies (American dream movies, super hero movies, and more. I am not discrediting Breaking Bad in any matter. The show's plot is unparalleled, not because of where it started but because of how it developed. How Walter became a criminal mastermind. How Jesse became so vulnerable. How the tables have turned so drastically.In Parasite, there is no development nor shock value (especially as to how the poor family will tear apart the rich family, perhaps so because of the title haha). I don't feel connected to the poor family. Their motives are weak and unfounded: they are mere criminals (now I can't say that their financial struggles is deserved or not because that is a whole another issue), but there is just too little build-up. Like I said, they just seem too smooth of criminals who's been in the field for decades.Conclusion: I have been chewing on this ever since I finished watching, but it could be that Bong didn't intend to hit on the points I made; like he didn't feel like he needed to add a strong shock value, or that the poor family needed more build-up. But overall, the plot was too predictable and unconvincing. I saw little pain and suffering of the poor; I wanted to see more jealousy and contempt towards the inequality; perhaps make the rich dad a corrupt CEO? Not just a regular man who's in the tech industry? I didn't feel bad for the poor family, nor did I feel disgusted by the rich family. I didn't think that the rich dude needed to die; I definitely don't think this family didn't deserve that, when in fact I should be triumphantly cheering for Ki-Tae to just go out on a killing spree. Him hiding in the basement was also very obvious. Would have been cool if they didn't reveal that and just show the malfunctioning light blink at a certain pattern, indirectly letting the audience know that Ki-Tae, who was supposedly gone missing, had hid in the basement. Showing not telling (done exquisitely in No Country for Old Men). Instead Bong put a longnarrative in the end which was not inspiring, shocking, nor meaningful. Bong just had the actor explain the whole thing in paragraphs.Proposal/Biggest Regret: Where I think they really could have taken this movie off was when the rich family cancelled their camping trip and came back: the family finding out about how the poor family was stabbing them from behind, and thus the rich family just mercilessly oppressing the poor family with extreme measures. That is the only part where I was curious about what was going to happen. I think that was where Bong could have given us some insight into the cruel, unfair, and corrupt capitalist society that he is (supposedly) trying to criticize and writing this satire about.Just some thoughts. Although I am in the never-ending search for good movies, I am no expert. I was just confused at how ppl thought this is Bong's greatest movie ever or even the best film of the 21st century for that matter.Subpar."
935,One viewing only,ccgriffin71,10 April 2021,10,I've only viewed this film once and everything about it was beautiful! From the addictive plot to the gorgeous cinematography Bong Joon Ho has crafted a modern masterpiece that I will be revisiting repeatedly.
936,"Tense, weird, compelling",mycannonball,15 December 2021,8,"This drama is tense with suspense and drama. It has some twists and turns and at times, it's dark and creepy. At other times, it's funny. It could have been edited down a good 20 minutes as it dragged in some places (esp. The setup) but overall, very good!"
937,Remembered all the hype,ccbowks,13 November 2023,10,"So I finally decided to watch this movie today and I am just blown away because I definitely heard about it when it first came out and all the awards and all the other movies it topped and granted I watched it with a baby and a toddler so it was a lot of pausing and definitely gonna rewatch it, but this movie was amazing from beginning, middle, and end. It was truly worthy of everything at one I am beyond surprised like I did not know what I was in Stored for I never read anything about it but I definitely wanted to see it and today was the day and I'm so glad I did like I would love to watch this with my husband and just sit back and enjoy it like this was hands-down, one of the best films. I've watched in a very long while and funny thing is, it was recommended when I was looking at what was like gone girl and I enjoyed that movie even though it pissed me off, but it was a great plot too, but this one was definitely one you wanna watch."
938,two stories in one,donaldricco,1 August 2020,8,"Beautifully filmed and acted! One family inserts itself into another, and neither will be the same again. And the way they address the socioeconomic disparities through the use of smell is really interesting. I didn't love the ending, but the rest was thoroughly engaging!"
939,Bong Joon Ho challenges our minds again.,joemitchell-10214,28 January 2022,9,PARASITE is a true psychological thriller with a ruthless ending that is a must watch for anyone who is a fan of thought provoking films. I watched this because Bong Joon Ho who wrote SNOWPIERCER also wrote and directed PARASITE.
940,Extraordinary,cartr94,11 May 2024,10,"At first I had some reluctance to watch this film, thinking that it is an ordinary Asian film that presents a story from a different corner of the earth than what we are probably used to in Hollywood films or those on our continent. But noticing the rather high rating on IMDB, I said: let's give it a try.The more minutes of viewing went by, the more I was struck by the originality and ideas of the South Korean director. The movie gets funnier along the way, after which extremely strange and funny things happen.I want to say that in my opinion it is an 11 film on a scale from 1 to 10 and that this film beats all the American and European films of the last decade."
941,A Solid Metaphor Film,zkonedog,24 March 2020,7,"Let me say right away here that ""Parasite"" may very well indeed be even better than a 7/10 star film. For my viewing experience, there were a number of factors that may well have dampened the overall experience. No matter how you slice it, though, ""Parasite"" is a solid metaphor film that engages both on surface and deep levels.For a very basic overview, this film focuses on two families in South Korea: The Kims are the definition of poor, living in a cramped sub-street level apartment and barely scraping together enough to subside. The Parks are much wealthier, living in a spacious mansion and employee tutors, drivers, and a housekeeper. Through a serious of events both fortuitous and comical, all four Kims become employed (in varying capacities) by the Kims. The juxtaposition between ""clans"" is readily apparent, and brought to an even starker contrast when a momentous discovery changes/defines the entire back half of the film's narrative.On the surface, ""Parasite"" is pretty entertaining, using a multi-genre approach to keep the viewer's interest. While watching, you will be treated to comedy, drama, farce, seriousness, etc. There is never a dull moment, in other words, and the acting is strong throughout. The subtitles only take a few minutes to get used to (from an American viewer perspective) and will quickly become second nature, so don't let that be the reason you may shy away from this movie.More importantly, though, ""Parasite"" is also very much a metaphor movie, dealing with class structures and the fundamentals of capitalism itself. I won't go into spoiler details here, but there are much deeper meanings here than simply what is visually/physically portrayed. Multiple, deeper readings/viewings of the material are very easy to pick out and analyze.Like I said in the opening paragraph, ""Parasite"" may be objectively higher than 7/10 stars. For me, though, it was watched during a nationwide pandemic state, in which it was hard to focus on the issues these filmmakers wanted to put forth. Also, and this is very much a personal preference, I prefer metaphor films to ""sneak up on me"" as opposed to knowing that going in. With this film, though, the cat was out of the bag after the Academy Awards, which is when it will garner the majority of its popular viewings. So, I knew to look for the ""deeper stuff"" from the get-go, and I feel like that may have influenced by overall viewing experience (and perhaps not for the better).So, as of right now, I'm giving ""Parasite"" a 7/10 ranking. A solid film that I enjoyed, but not necessarily amongst my personal all-time favorites. Perhaps upon a second viewing in a different personal/social climate, it will climb the ranks further. It certainly won't go any lower."
942,9/10,hsonhpy,14 September 2023,9,"I think the film does a good job of exploring the theme of class. The Kim family is a poor family who is constantly struggling to make ends meet. They are forced to take on menial jobs and live in a cramped basement apartment. The Park family, on the other hand, is a wealthy family who lives in a luxurious mansion. The two families are worlds apart, and the film explores the ways in which the Kim family tries to exploit the Park family's wealth.The film shows how deception can be used to gain power and influence, but it also shows how it can backfire.Good film for anyone who enjoys dark and twisted comedies, or for anyone who is interested in the themes of class and deception."
943,An enjoyable movie,xelacam,19 January 2023,7,"A brilliant an enjoyable movie to watch, I was invested throughout the whole film. Although in parts it dragged however there was great character building and ultimately I cared for all the characters I wasn't sure who the hero or the villain was!But the ending, wow I was gobsmacked. I knew something bad would happen but didn't think it would be that bad. I must admit that I was a little confused as to why the poor father (Sorry, I've forgotten their names) killed the rich father just because he stank. Didn't feel that would happen in real life and did feel rather ridiculous.The film was very long I felt they could've cut parts and perhaps gave us more closure towards the end. Every scene after the stabbings felt rushed and it was alot of information to take in, felt like they could've elaborated on this part on the movie.7-8/10."
944,1 out 10 ....and that's being generous.,brickfilming,24 February 2020,1,"Either I am living in an alternate universe - or this movie is being reviewed by paid reviewers in favor of promoting Parasite.I left the cinema after an hour. I haven't done that in 10 + years.
Incredibly boring movie.
Overacting pervasive.
Story-line pedestrian.
Give it a wide birth..don't waste your money , or more importantly your time on this movie."
945,So much to unpack with this one....,pauladrivers,25 May 2020,9,Genre defying. There is so much happening in this movie - just when you think you have figured it out it shows you something different. It leaves you wondering - who really is the Parasite?
946,That was Amazing,fattah_1369,27 December 2022,9,"Hi everyone
I didn't know anything about the story of the movie, the actors, and the awards that this movie won before watching the movie, and I was interested in seeing it only because of the relatively good ratings given by the viewers.When I saw the movie, I was really involved and I liked the acting of the actors and the narration of the movieIt is rare that you really enjoy and admire a movie after watching itAfter watching the movie, I came to the imdb website and did a small review about this movie, and when I saw that it won four Oscars and won and was nominated in dozens of other festivals, it became even more admirable.I don't want to talk about the details of the story, firstly because it has already been discussed by others, and secondly, you will get the pleasure of seeing it for the first time.It was very heartwarming and exciting for me."
947,Unexpected and Thought-Provoking,spencerkidner,7 September 2024,9,"Beautifully shot, acted, and written, this film is a unique specimen. About halfway through, the tone shifts quite dramatically, but is done in a way that doesn't feel abrupt. The characters feel real, and the main family has such a powerful dynamic. When the tension amps up, its palpable and keeps viewers engaged.While I am not an expert in Korean culture, I feel like this film does a great job of teaching through showing. The gaps in class are shown masterfully, and the poor family's views on the rich family make sense. I would definitely recommend this movie to all fans of foreign cinema, and film in general."
948,MELHOR FILME DO MUNDO,sunfavs,19 December 2021,10,"Que filme perfeito, cenas incriveis, roteiro peculiar, amo tudo. História é genial, muito diferente de tudo que ja vi. Que filme perfeito, cenas incriveis, roteiro peculiar, amo tudo. História é genial, muito diferente de tudo que ja vi."
949,"You will see the consequences of social inequity shot in such a interestingly relatable manner, it will be hard to dislike it",zoropirate,14 November 2023,10,"Filmmaker Bong Joon Ho once again surprised us with another masterpiece named Parasite. Where powerful social satire meets tragedy. The director did a great job portraying South Korea's current views on society exposing the underprivileged slums of most modern cities and it's citizens living in completely different worlds despite staying in close proximity. You are likely to find it relatable as the themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, but all over the world. Having its fair share of global capitalism and universal materialism, Meritocracy being the biggest trope of this movie.Now, the best way to enjoy this film is to cluelessly get into it, its charm is to watch it progress and unfold in many satisfying, unexpected ways.You can definitely see a unique directorial vision as Parasite welcomes the audience into multi-genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act. Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy drama, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. It is one of the hardest things to pull off but the director converts them smoothly without letting the audience feel indifferent to the transformation. It manages to elicit the full range of responses, making the viewer react with uneasy laughter to unexpected situations that eventually lead to disturbing events full of horror.Now, who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor?Satirically, it managed to portray how we may live under the same skies, but have different views regarding life.--
""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.""Success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it, those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, but for those who cannot escape their sad reality will ultimately turn for the worse and thus start to justify their immoral backstabbing, deceit, and callousness for reasoning that can be only explained by growing up poor without support from others.The characters all have different aspects to them that will be received and viewed differently due to the viewers own biases and world views. This isn't a bad thing as the movies main point is to deliver a provocative social commentary in various metaphors. And the best way to do so is to create morally questionable characters that will resemble at least one familiar person known to you.,,Greed is inside each one of us, but the question is, how much are you willing to sacrifice for an idea of life in comfort?''
---
All in all, Parasite is a fantastic case of hard-hitting yet entertaining cinema.And one of the best movies recently made in Korea."
950,Para Para... Parasite!,questl-18592,25 September 2023,8,"I wish I could hop in a DeLorean Phone Booth and travel back in time. Not all that long ago, just to a place before Parasite became ubiquitous with greatness. It's my own fault, coming to it late. At first, I didn't get to it because of life, then I avoided it because of the hype, then I felt like I needed to wait till the right moment to properly enjoy it but the hype never quite died down, did it?Watching this now, I can't say a bad thing about it. It's brilliantly shot, everything tracks and makes sense on the screen. The story is fascinating and feels fresh and different. The acting is all spot on, even managing to make characters that really shouldn't be likable... Likable. The metaphors laid out are relevant and neither feel like they are assaulting you or like you need an advance degree in film theory to understand. It's all good stuff.So why don't I love this movie? I liked it. I did. But I wanted to come away from it with a sense of awe. I wanted to feel the masterpiece that is Parasite, like the rest of the world seems to have felt it. Instead, I feel like it's good, really good even, but I don't quite get the hype. If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say it's probably because I don't connect with the characters all that much, save for one. Everyone else here felt pretty basic to me.I absolutely plan to watch this again. I want to uncover what's here, I want to see what everyone else sees in it. As of right now though, definitely haver to put Snowpiercer above this one, in my own personal preference rankings."
951,"Read but feel very false, rich and poor are not real",h-80434,1 April 2020,6,"Poor people can cheat, all of them are good at deception, with this deception and acting, but still live in the basement? The rich can be naive, the whole family simple without brains, was sold to help a few money, really can live in a big villa?"
952,Hollywood watch and learn.,meiranog,14 December 2020,9,"One of the best movies in recent years!
Quirky,original and visually stunning.
It keeps you on the edge of your seat with constant plot changing.All in a very subtle way.
Finally a worthy winner!
It will stay with you for days and most importantly ....it will make you forget La La Land."
953,Good story but too hyped,ektasharma,19 March 2020,6,"The story was good. Acting is great. It basically shows the reality of rich and poor difference that exists in our society no matter what. My only reason to give it 6 star is with all the hype this movie has, My expectations were way too high and sadly it didn't live upto that."
954,This movie isn't for me.,Strawberry_Tea,22 May 2020,4,"I'm torn on how to rate this. The acting was good, the cinematography was pretty amazing, and I was captivated by the plot, but I just really didn't like the story.Most of the characters seem like terrible people. At first they were fine, dude was taking a job. All good, he helped his sister get a job by lying. Eh, fine whatever. Then getting other people fired to take their jobs... and then it all ends in murder? I'm not confused by the plot, but rather confused about why people love this so much. Granted, it's probably just not my thing. I tend to not like movies where most of the characters are terrible people and there's basically no redeeming qualities. Classics that people love, ""Gone with The Wind"" and ""Grease"", are two movies I hate.
This movie did nothing for me, other than leaving me confused on it's point. If you loved it, that's fine. I'm not trying to hate on this movie, or people who like it, I just don't get the hype.After watching a video explaining the themes a bit more, I decided to add two more stars to my rating. I understand the themes and why they are important, but this movie isn't for me."
955,A good drama and mind gripping series,sunnyraut-50276,5 October 2023,8,"The series is all about a family showing through the differences in between the classes in the society too, a great series to binge watch too. The series is always gripping the story line and keeps the watcher entertained as well as on the edge to whats going to happen next in the series.The series is a good walkthrough the differences in the state of the life in our society depending upon the finically or physically. The series as all the pov and everything for all the characters in the series so the audience gets the mindset and the vision for all the character's in it to understand there situation from there view."
956,indescribable,montanaromichael,29 May 2024,10,"""Parasite"" is an immense masterpiece. A few days ago I started to seriously interest myself in the vision, starting to look at the various trailers then passing to the reviews...but it did not appeal to me at all. Then one evening I decided to see if this film is really a masterpiece as everyone says or if it is just an extremely overrated film. Well, there are no other possibilities, this film is just a masterpiece. This film surprised me a lot! The characters are sensational: very interesting, well characterized, excellently interpreted. There is not one character that I liked much more than the others, but if I have to mention a few, these are Kim and Ki-Jung. The actors are extraordinary, each one left something inside me. The setting is phenomenal, from the first image you understand perfectly the economic and family situation of the Ki-taek family and then also that of the Park family. I really liked the link with the title of the film ""Parasite"", a metaphor about what the Ki-taek family does in the film. I really liked the drastic change of emotions during the film: it goes from fun and tranquility to tension and anxiety with a scene, extraordinary. Bong Joon-ho's direction is fabulous and in fact it deserved the Oscar. Every award won by this film is extremely deserved. I really liked the choice of objects and the settings that always come back during the film. The ending of the film is incredible, I would never have expected such a turn in a film that seemed highly quiet. I have no other arguments to describe more about what this film represents in the cinema. Indescribable.I can't wait to see it again..
Rating: 10/10."
957,A Quarantine Masterpiece.,aciessi,23 May 2020,10,"Better late than never, I say. Parasite has shocked the film world, in the best way possible. Against all odds, it defeated a crowded field for Best Picture at the Oscars. A field that included heavy hitters like Scorsese and Tarantino. Nobody should have ever counted Parasite out, but the Oscars don't have a track record of awarding Best Picture to groundbreaking independent films, let alone a groundbreaking independent film from South Korea. It's win was a watershed moment for filmmakers everywhere. It's a shot in the arm for original storytellers in a time that seems dominated by Disney related properties and remakes. Garnering international acclaim, people have hailed Parasite as the best film of 2019, and the decade itself. Does it live up to the hype? The answer is an enthusiastic yes.Parasite is one of the best independent films I've ever seen. It's a textbook example of how to take a small idea, and a modest script, with limited locations and launch them all into the stratosphere. Without giving too much away, it centers around two families on opposite sides of the Korean social class. The ultra rich, elite class and the poor. The poor family devises an elaborate scheme to work as servants for the rich family, in the hopes that they can take a taste of aristocratic life, and work their way up the ladder. All is well, until they discover something underneath the house. A third class of servitude is revealed. A class more destitute and subservient to the rich family than the poor family could ever dream of. Reminiscent of The Twilight Zone, Parasite serves as an allegory for income inequality and the ways in which the poorest classes of people are often exploited by the rich, with no thanks in return.The best horror films out there tell stories of larger meaning. They need to in order to be properly scary. Bong-Joon Ho allows his agenda to take shape throughout, but cleverly and gracefully, avoids being heavy-handed. For instance, there are no clear heroes and villains in his characters. To Ho, they are all victims of a larger societal struggle. In terms of its visual scope, Parasite is a masterclass in production design and framing. Instantly, the luxurious Park residence has become an iconic backdrop in film history. It's spacious rooms and narrow hallways paint a chilling picture of the enormity of wealth. The large screen door leading to the front yard is reminiscent of a large film screen, almost designed to showcase the importance of the Park family household. At 135 minutes, Parasite tells it's story as fitfully as a best-selling novel. In the end, you don't leave Parasite having missed the point of having watched it. It's satisfying, minute to minute. That's what makes this a great film."
958,Bong Joon-Ho's ultimate genre-defying chef d'oeuvre embodies class warfare and capitalist hysteria,FelipeCarrillo,8 June 2020,10,"In Bong Joon-Ho's game-changing social critique, the rich and the wretched descends into capitalist hell in sardonic, comical, and horribly grounded fashion.Notions of class hierarchy have been told and retold by cinema over the decades. Predominately attached to the socioeconomic spectrum, stratification has always stirred up a profound impact on societies' minds when it comes from caustic satires or reactive commentaries. Ranging from Michael Bay's greedy paradox ""Pain & Glory"" to Alfonso Cuaron's autobiographical black-and-white gem, from Sean Baker's thoughtful portrait of post-financial crisis in ""The Florida Project"" to Paul Feig's Oscar-nominated powerhouse ""Bridesmaids"", capitalist prototypes and social dynamics have come and gone in all sorts of unimaginable shapes to bring out the inner demons of human survival.In times of cholera and uncertainty, Bong Joon-Ho's latest and buzziest masterpiece comes like a head-turning accomplishment, a surgically accurate class fable, a truly gripping multi-genre piece of entertainment, and a reinvigorating storytelling-rich decade-new awake. Ever since its Palme d'Or win, ""Parasite"" has been ground-breaking new history, not only by becoming the very first non-English language, non-epic-length period drama nabbing the Best Picture award at the 2020 Oscars ceremony- golden ticket Cuaron's ""Roma"" lost to polarizing, preachy ""Green Book"" back in 2019 -but by giving new life into movie-going experience in an aging era of convoluted streaming-service battles and rowdy franchise-building tentpoles.In a way, ""Parasite"" feels like the ""Inception"" of this new century. Back in 2010, Christopher Nolan's towering 160-million Russian doll odyssey opened several doors industry-wise, putting the absolute, always-coveted formula into one single movie: crushing box office incomes, cerebral, wholly original storytelling, and, above else, priceless craftsmanship power. However, Nolan did not treasure any social-resounding message as sharply as Bong Joon-Ho did overseas. ""Parasite"", on the other hand, is a small-budgeted, South-Korean thinking piece that, even while managing different procedures- it turned out to be more profitable than Nolan's pic -comes to the very same conclusion: great filmmaking is the key. Social-headed slices of art would never be about big budgets and small films like ""Get Out"" and ""The Invisible Man"" are proving that studios, either big or small, may still conquer audiences with entertaining, on-point storytelling.Script-wise, ""Parasite"" is an utter knockout. At first glance, the most outstanding, praised features the film exposes now and again are its turns and twists, the comings and goings of a story where everything mutes into something unexpected. These ""think-again"" premium plot devices are the main pulling force for mainstream audiences, even though they are not the most powerful assets Joon-Ho has to offer. The truly one-of-a-kind centerpieces are: proceedings and composition.Take for instance the 5-minute towering montage at the end of the first act, where black humor, cadence and rhythm are the beating heart of the sequence. It builds and places anticipation at the highest level by using endless narrative tricks to convey the emotions and reactions the film intends to spring up, blurring the line between good and bad, between wealth and the poverty, between sarcasm and irony.The film succeeds at it, mainly, from hugely magnetic characters. When first we met the Kim family, they leave their banjiha's windows wide-open in order to get free extermination. They are poor, unemployed and Wi-Fi-needed. The film develops them one by one in a highly audience-catching way, picturing them as both victims and victimizers as the film evolves. Later on, the Park family steps in. They are wealthy, intellectual, picture-perfect individuals. However, unlike the Kim family, the Parks are not portrayed as villains until the masterfully executed final sequence, where each missing piece fits in. For most of its running time, they are naïve, nice elite people who do not want to get sick by their long-time loyal housekeeper. And that feeling of correspondence the film gets from its audience, regardless of origin, race or social status, comes from a core aspect: empathy. We care about them, we are invested in their tragedies, we are as worried and shocked as the characters themselves. Empathy is paramount for wining audiences over, without it, most of the film's purposes would be directly trashed out, and the South-Korean director knows it better than anyone; if not, just take a look at any of his previous works.Every one of the characters succeeds at becoming storytelling backbones because of the amazing ensemble cast, which- by the way -became the very first foreign Ensemble Winner at SAG Awards, making, one more time, movie history. Park So-dam, Lee Sun-kyun, Choi Woo-shik, Cho Yeo-jeong, and Song Kang-ho deliver award-worthy performances, endowing to the story tangible, three-dimensional characters that, in incompetent hands, would come out as hollow caricatures.Bong Joon-Ho's pictures are described as many things at once: black comedies, social commentaries, genre-crossing post-apocalyptic adventures. Owning every inch of them, ""Parasite"" spices the mix up with deeper, timely metaphors- make no mistake, peaches and basements are not going to be the same; - however, the film owes it to two crucial aspects: visual language and edition. Camera movements, blocking and visual composition are masterfully managed by the director and his crew. It could have been a silent film, and still it would speak volumes. Cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo executes his vision with perverse precision and voyeuristic delight, grabbing class divide by the throat. What could have ended up as a mere style exercise between the shady lighting from the semi-basement and the luxury LED lighting of the main mansion, it is now the perfect visual cocktail: sophistication and softness, luxury and poverty, ups and downs, dark and light, hungry beasts in empty spaces.""Okja"" composer Jaeil Jung plays an important role as well, shaping the mood and complementing the atmosphere, endowing the film with rich, elegant, horror-like sound scales, getting a heart-stopping, small yet often disturbing soundtrack by adding up layer after layer of complex composed sounds.""Gisaengchung"" by Bong Joon-Ho is the crowning achievement of the decade. Many critics have healed it as ""the picture of the year"" and, even if it is tout à fait true, ""Parasite"" transcends the boundaries of society-headed, industry-transforming films; say Jordan Peele's ambitious allegory ""Us"" reimagined through the lens and voices of Shakespeare, Hitchcock and Kim Ki-young, and still you are nowhere near to it. Many talented, socially-aware filmmakers and their equally committed crews have paved the way through the years; now Bong Joon-Ho, in total command of his craft, has made it: ""Parasite"" is a groundbreaking work of art."
959,Almost Perfection,loner_aarush_jain,27 October 2023,8,"I really loved this movie, i had heard about it in the past and even watched the trailer but saved it for later, watched it in its original language with english subtitles. You won't need english dubbing to watch it.The cast was nice, the acting was phenomenal and the plot itself was soo epic and very well paced that this movie keeps you focused in your chair througout.The only reason i have not given it a 10 star rating is because of the ending.Spoiler alert:I really wished that they would've shown some sign of goodness in the rich ppl in the end, instead it just completely portrays them as bad ppl who only care about themselves even in the time of an emergency.The movie would have reached extreme heights and beyond all expectations if the writers would have shows that there is goodness in all of us, no-matter rich or poor.But i guess im more optimistic in general.Anyways,
Definitely worth watching, Enjoy."
960,One of the best films,nerizbanch,10 September 2024,8,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10. Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.

961,It's a simple message,Syakirin-Ghazali,10 March 2020,7,"The movie's poster looks like it's going to be a thriller/horror genre but I was wrong. It was more drama and reality. I was not that impressed with the storyline. The actors did a good performance of realness but for me this movie does not really add something new to me knowledge that I would had never thought of. I must say the production was great as South Korea really is known for their Dramas which is similar to this movie. Will definitely recommend people of this movie but for me the x factor is missing and also the ending is a bit odd and not well planned.
Thats it for me. Thanks for reading."
962,An interesting and fresh take,madisonroberts-20352,4 January 2023,8,"Parasite, directed by Bong Joon-Ho, is a dark satirical film on wealth and inequality. The low-class families in the film are much like parasites, forced to feed off others in order to survive. However, like with parasites, the Kim family couldn't help but to gluttonously take advantage of their situation until the only way out was through drastic measures. What I found most interesting however, is the end of the film. The son seems to have a change of heart, and decided to create his own fortune rather than rely on others. Wether or not he succeeds in this is up for debate, but I found that to be a twist on the movie that really made me think."
963,Very good movie,thor1903,6 June 2020,7,"7.5 = very good movie (for me 8+ is excellent)+ Well shot movie
+ Good cast
+ good dialogue
+ 'Memorable epilogue'
+ Some good Tarantino like momentsCliched horror/thriller 'slasher' finale with the typical horror movie music. Not original but suprising nonetheless.Could have developed characters slightly better."
964,Why did this get an Oscar?,misterlampgames,3 November 2020,5,"Now this isn't a bad movie, not at all. Just so overhyped, which kinda ruined it with me. I feel like people like this just because it's so politically right, like what happened with black panther. Just because it's something you believe in doesn't mean it's good. I felt like it was way too long. And how did this get an Oscar over 1917, which is obviously superior especially in the visual category. I just don't understand why so many people like this mediocre film."
965,Suprised movie socially ever!!!,strwcksn,14 May 2024,9,"""Parasite,"" directed by Bong Joon-ho, tells the story of the Kim family, who live in poverty in a semi-basement apartment in Seoul. Their luck changes when their son, Ki-woo, gets a job as an English tutor for the wealthy Park family. One by one, the Kim family members infiltrate the Park household by posing as skilled professionals, exploiting opportunities and coincidences to secure their positions.The strength of ""Parasite"" lies in its plot, which is full of surprises and flows seamlessly. Bong Joon-ho masterfully blends elements of drama, comedy, and thriller to create a story that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. The narrative highlights the stark class divide between the Kim and Park families and explores how each family exploits the other for their gain.The actors deliver exceptional performances. Song Kang-ho, as Ki-taek, the father of the Kim family, portrays a man desperate yet determined with deep emotional nuance. Choi Woo-shik and Park So-dam, as Ki-woo and Ki-jung, stand out with their clever and opportunistic characters. Lee Sun-kyun and Cho Yeo-jeong, as the Park family, provide a sharp contrast with their naivety and obliviousness to the harsh realities outside their luxurious life.The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is stunning. Each shot is meticulously planned, adding depth to the story. The use of space and lighting effectively illustrates the social and emotional contrasts between the two families. The production design further enhances this theme, with the opulent and modern Park house juxtaposed against the cramped and dingy Kim residence.""Parasite"" offers a biting critique of social and economic inequality in contemporary society. Bong Joon-ho vividly depicts class differences and examines how these disparities influence human behavior and relationships. The film encourages viewers to reflect on issues of morality, injustice, and the human struggle for survival in an unfair system.In conclusion, ""Parasite"" is a masterpiece that entertains while provoking deep thought. With its clever plot, strong characters, and beautiful cinematography, the film effectively conveys profound social messages without being preachy. It is no surprise that the film has received widespread acclaim and numerous prestigious awards.As a critic, finding flaws in ""Parasite"" is challenging. Some viewers might find the moments of dark comedy and the plot twists to be excessive, but for many, these elements enhance the film's appeal and uniqueness."
966,Incredible,cboone-18096,8 March 2020,10,It's hard to pinpoint what's so great about this movie. Just watch it.
967,Intelligent and thought provoking,Southamptonfan,5 February 2021,10,"Who are the parasites? This is the question going through your mind throughout the film. That's why this film is so good. The rich family living their lives without a care in the world. The poor family desperate to survive. Are the rich family kind, selfish or both? What about the poor family? Who are the parasites? Both families? When the rain comes and floods the ""poor people"", the rich family can only say how pleased they are to have the rain. But is it because they are selfish or are they blissfully unaware? This is story of how people view the world after experiencing two different lives. It's brilliant, full of questions and thoughts."
968,Confused feelings,itsoneua,10 September 2023,9,"At first you will think that the movie is normal and tells the story of an extraneous family, but the end will show you how crazy it is I loved how it made me conflicted in my feelings, and this is what made me give it 9, even though it is not the best in many respects, but it was a special experience.How the ending was presented is exactly the thing that aroused my interest, and between a hater, a shocker, and a lover, I stuck my thoughts and feelings towards the movie.I loved the viewing experience so much that at the end it made me stop a few times scratching my head in shock and I'm glad I did."
969,I found this while looking for parasyte,judealexharnett,19 November 2023,10,"I feel bad for people who refuse to watch foreign films purely because they don't want to read subtitles and whatnot because they are really missing out. For the first half of this movie it's great, just a story about a poor family who tries to integrate themselves into the lifestyle of a Rich family. The second half is like really weird though but I enjoyed it. Does it deserve all the praise it gets? Honestly I'd say yes. Like this is one of the best onscreen portrayals of economic inequality and corruption of wealth I've ever seen. The ending is brilliant, but I wouldn't even call it bong joon he's best.10/10."
970,A masterpiece of social commentary and thrilling storytelling,emasiosavarino,11 May 2024,9,"Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly weaves together elements of satire, suspense, and social commentary. Set in modern-day South Korea, the film follows the impoverished Kim family as they cunningly infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Park family. What begins as a tale of deception and manipulation soon spirals into a gripping exploration of class struggle and the disparity between the haves and have-nots.The brilliance of ""Parasite"" lies in its ability to keep viewers on the edge of their seats while delivering thought-provoking commentary on societal inequality. Through its captivating characters and meticulously crafted plot twists, the film challenges viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about privilege, greed, and the human condition.From its stunning cinematography to its stellar performances, ""Parasite"" captivates audiences from start to finish. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, leaving you pondering its implications and eager to revisit its intricacies again and again."
971,Good for one time but also overrated for Oscar,injeetsingh,13 March 2020,7,"It was good but for one time only, I dont understand why it got Oscar, Overrated in one word."
972,A good film but....,MazzyMayhem-117-544511,25 March 2021,8,"I did enjoy this film, but it didn't strike me as a worthy Oscar winner."
973,Keeps you curious,czelner,11 March 2020,No rating,"The score and the overall tone of the movie is so excellently filmed, each scene draws you in and you're not sure quite what will happen next."
974,The movie is good until the plot twist.,adayinagrabah,14 July 2019,7,"The movie and all the comedy elements in it are good, but the plot points are just too weird and too over the top.7 is okay and logical but 8 or more is too much for this.
Seriously guys."
975,Great ... until the end-game,steve-696-199676,8 January 2021,5,"I see people really raving over the film and the awards it won, so I was keen to see it, sounded great. And it was great until about two thirds through when the ending kicks in.The ending was just so-so, seemed to build up to a crescendo and then the plot let the actors down."
976,Absolutely brilliant.,fabiannett,25 August 2020,9,"Saw it in cinema twice. Have nothing bad to say about it. I knew Bong-Joon Ho from Okja, which was a decent movie but not very special. So when it came out at a film festival I decided to go see it and I wasn't disappointed."
977,"darkly humorous, compelling, dramatic.",Ali-Elshamaly,17 February 2022,10,"The latest film for Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho, Parasite, might very well be his best film to date. Parasite is a thought-provoking film that's part dark comedy, part family drama and part thriller. It's not really a singular genre film, but all these elements complement each other to deliver a surprisingly intense and shocking cinematic experience.Meet the Kim family, a down-on-their-luck, destitute family of four. Living in an impoverished basement in a South Korean slum, they are forced to glum off of other people's WiFi networks and take menial side jobs folding pizza boxes to bring in a pittance of money. The family's eldest son, Ki-woo (Choi), failed to make it into university, but what he lacks in book smarts, he makes up for in street smarts. He's a natural con artist with the gift of gab. An opportunity soon falls into Ki-woo's lap in the form of a job recommendation. His best friend, Min (Park Seo-joon), is traveling abroad and wants Ki-woo to take over tutoring one of his well-to-do teen students, Park Da-hye (Jung). Min-Hyuk has a romantic interest in the high-school sophomore Da-Hye and wants Ki-woo to watch over her and keep away potential suitors while he's abroad. Min-Hyuk's master plan is to start dating Da-hye when she enters university.Min-Hyuk's trust in a scam artist like Ki-woo is probably the biggest mistake of his life. With the help of his sister Ki-jung's (Park So-dam) exceptional forgery skills, Ki-woo is easily able to maneuver himself into the rich, well-to-do Park household as the new English tutor for Da-hye. Da-hye's mother, Mrs. Park (Jo Yeo-jeong), is a flighty, snooty simp. She makes for an easy mark for the Kim family to assert themselves into the lives of the Park homestead.After Ki-woo hatches a master plan, he's able to manipulate Ki-jung into the Park home as the art tutor for the Park's youngest child, Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). Next up, the kids trick the Park family patriarch, (Lee Sun-kyun), to fire his driver and hire their dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho). After that, it's the family housekeeper, Moon-gwang (Lee Jeong-eun), who gets ousted and replaced by the Kim kids' mother, Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin). However, Ki-woo's carefully layered plan is nothing more than a house of cards, and a dark secret within the Park household threatens to shatter the Kim's ticket to money and luxury.Parasite is a brilliantly shot movie. It's very much a product of its country of origin. As a result, its style is both unique and refreshing when compared to Hollywood films. It's darkly comedic, but it's not exactly an irreverent comedy. At other times, the film is darkly tragic and surprisingly poignant.The lengths to which the Kim family goes to con and manipulate the Park family are both shocking, and at times, borderline detestable. The one thing that keeps the Kim family from being outright unlikable is their true familial bond. The Kim family is comprised of down-and-out scoundrels, and yet, they still love, respect and appreciate each other. Meanwhile, the white-collar Park family members are self-absorbed, obsessed with their status, image and wealth, and they appear to lack genuine love for one another. If anything, it appears that their wealth and status have made them soft and gullible. The Parks look down at others of a lower social standing. It's evident that while material wealth might bring certain comforts and convenience, it doesn't bring true love or happiness.This is a remarkable film about the rich vs. The poor and the dynamics therein. While the Parks are generally the protagonists of the story, they are not good people. One imagines if Ki-woo, who comes off as quite brilliant, would likely be better served investing his talents into more legitimate pursuits. His sister, Ki-jung, is equally brilliant and a gifted graphic artist. It's bizarre that these two couldn't apply themselves in school or make it into university. Perhaps that's either a flaw in the storytelling or commentary on the South Korean academic system.The performances of the main cast are impeccable. Song Kang-ho, as Kim Ki-taek, really steals the show with some surprisingly dramatic and bittersweet moments. While Ki-woo is the basic protagonist of Parasite, Ki-taek is the heart and soul of the movie. The second and third acts feature plot twists that are both surprising and shockingly satisfying. They are twists the audience will not see coming, but they make complete and total sense. Those are the best kind of cinematic ""gotcha"" moments.Bong Joon-ho and cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo construct some beautiful imagery. The film is wonderfully shot. The shots are very straightforward, crisp and clear, yet contain all sorts of compelling imagery. The third act also features some quick, surprising, shocking bits of violence and gore that are rather Tarantino-esque. Parasite pulls no punches in terms of its visuals and narratives.While many are throwing around the word ""masterpiece"" for this film, it might be premature to call it that. Bong Joon-ho has created something with Parasite that's darkly humorous, compelling, dramatic, poignant and bittersweet all at the same time. Parasite is a true cinematic experience that will leave the audience with a lot to chew on during the ride home."
978,Flawless - A gift to cinema and cinematic arts,jashminocha,19 November 2019,10,"There will be movies after parasite and before parasite. There are not enough words for me to describe a movie like this, and i'm not gonna even try.
it's a masterpiece comes in once in every generation."
979,Feel from the bottom of the society,monbaza,3 July 2019,10,"After watching, I see my fight against the system (life, society, Capitalism) as a fight for all of the people who still eager for a fight."
980,Easy to Understand,chang-angel,4 August 2019,10,"The movie is simple in the fact that people like to move up the ladder. Seems removed from our lives, yet things start spiralling out of control, their lives seem not so different from our own daily lives. After some reflection, relatable. Who are the parasites in this society? Is it us? Or them? Or aren't we all living our lives in a cacoon, may it be a luxurious mansio or a rundown flat. We are no better those next to us, and they to us."
981,Have you got a plan?,CupPusta,12 February 2020,10,"No plan is the (best) plan. No position is final. Every life is there to improvise, when the chance is. No fixed values, don't fool yourself. No fixed position (though, society place their limits - or gives opportunities) - it all can change unexpectedly at any given moment. No main roles - each life is a role in itself. So - what's the value? Well, whatever conservative it may sound (especially for a motion-picture like this one) - family values. That's your opportunities, your backup - add some lottery and improvisation - life depicted. Lot of points to the story told (and how), and to actors' play. Lots of points to all the different prospectives - as you see the unrolling event from all the eyes of all the engaged persons (it is a value that many of today RPG have - you can play as any of persons involved - and see from their point of view - and feel their values). I wouldn't call it a drama, neither a ""social comedy"" though. It isn't a detective story either. It's a very talented director's work, play-writer's as well (ah, he's the same one...). It's an amazing cast. And it's more than fairly valued/rewarded - with the ""golden palm"" and a lot of ""oscars"" (despite critics' grumble - what so many ""oscars"" given for...). That one surely goes into a world cinematic library - to be a modern classic."
982,parasites,juankduque,13 March 2020,No rating,"The first thing that attract me about these movie was the title, it shows a type of misery about what is going to happen in the movie and what it is about, the poster also catch my attention because in the poster it show us a family with the faces behind a black band so is very intriguing for the person's that what to watch it.In the movie they present a poor family that live in misery, but a great opportunity is going to change their lives .A friend of the youngest son of the family offers him a job in a rich house because he was one of the best English speakers in the city, the poor men accepted the job and went to the house of the rich family. He quickly won the confidence of the family, and he started to enter all his family to work on the rich house, the poor father was the driver, the poor mother was the new housekeeper, and the poor sister was the art teacher. When all of this happens they realise that the house have a dark secret.In conclusión this is one of the best movies in the world, it won an Oscar for the best movie and its not a waste of time to watch it."
983,"Good, but not great",simevo-20093,17 February 2020,7,"Quite how this managed to win best picture at the Oscars is beyond me. How it won best director is truly daft, especially up against the magnificent Sam Mendes.
It's a really good first half of character set up, though they themselves are never really developed, witty and fast paced, followed by a let down of a second half that doesn't deliver on its midway point revelations."
984,Best Movie ever made,bumbeldumbel,14 February 2020,10,"I really loved this movie, you should also at least give it a try."
985,Post Oscar Review,r-chloes,10 February 2020,7,"I watched Parasite yesterday before the Oscars, and was truly disappointed. The ending just turned what could've been a great movie into a good one.
So I was shocked for the all the love that it received from the Academy! I truly believe there were so many better international films that deserved best script/director/picture awards such as Separation by Asghar Farahadi !!"
986,Just terrible,jimbo-11554,7 November 2020,2,I so wanted to love this given the reviews I have heard but I was left wondering what film other people had seen. Idea was good but it was a nothing story in the end. So disappointed. Found the subtitles too small. Just could not have cared less. Why all the hype?
987,Absolute work of art,Oliveraandreasson,6 January 2020,10,"As director Bong Joon-ho said during his Golden Globe-speech after winning best foreign film for ""parasite"": ""Once you overcome the one-inch tall barriers of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films."", and I am so happy I did. Having heard only good things about the movie I expected a lot, but it still exceeded my expectations tenfold.Firstly, the writing is incredible. What seems to be quite a simple story about a family commiting fraud and deceipt to escape poverty, changes throughout the numerous twist and turns into something very unexpected, interesting and absolutely brilliant. The pacing is on point and from start to finish, the film takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions including, but not limited to: sadness, a feeling of well-deserved success, hapiness, guilt, unease, discomfort and fear.Secondly, the score is fantastic and greatly accentuates these different feelings into something more. For example, the many intense and thrilling scenes are strengthened into a crippling suspense that leaves you unable to lose focus and calm down.Finally, the ending is absolutely wonderful, although it also houses about the only critisism I have for this movie. After about half of the film I found myself wondering how on earth they were going to be able to pull of the ending, but they did, and it was not what I expected. Some of the decisions the characters make in the final act seems a bit out of left field and takes them in directions that doesn't neccesarily feel right. I do however think that's the point and it brings a very intriguing point about the movie's theme into question.In short, ""Parasite"" is nothing short of a masterpiece."
988,Deserves all the awards and more...,roofbreaker,13 February 2020,10,This movies is so beautifuly woven together. It's a good look at how humans seperate because of that piece of green paper called money. It shows the sadness and weight of what the poor deal with. Their lives not unimportant but treated as unimportant. It shows that education although a tool for wealth does not teach common sense or protect anyone from their safety called money. Just as the poor are not protected in their strong hunger for it. It's a mad cycle. Eye opener to look within your heart and find out the agenda of how valuable life is over money. Make sure you watch for all the beautifully done allegory's in the film.
989,One of the few movies that is gonna be remembered for a long time,vionaanggraeni,22 July 2019,10,"Honstly i never feel the need to write review but this one.. Wow i cant say anything coz it will ruin the surprise. But really , you would get out from the cinema feeling a mixture of everything.This is genius. 🙌🏻🙌🏻"
990,really awesome,kikio_,25 June 2019,10,"Best movie i've ever seen in decade, everything is so brilliant"
991,Sooo good!,shaylad2055,22 February 2020,10,This movie is amazing! One of the best films I have ever seen. Parasite definitely deserved to win Best Picture despite no matter how much a certain somebody disagrees. Don't let subtitles keep you from experiencing this wonderful piece of movie art!
992,Thouroughly Enjoyed,darius_sutherland,11 February 2020,8,"Parasite is slow to start but an enjoyable movie that takes you on a ride. It is a contender for the awards definetly and even though it won I am happy it did as I don't think there was a huge choice to be made. This year for me it was Joker, Richard Jewel and this.There are some flaws but overall a wonderful piece of cinema beautifully crafted."
993,Brilliant,isahems,8 March 2020,No rating,"This film is Brilliant! I loved it. The portrayal of class struggles, the twists and the tense moments...amazing. This film was brilliantly executed! It is a masterpiece. If you havent seen it yet, dont wait."
994,"If The Movie Was Made In America, Everyone Would Think It Was Average",PhatManBad,8 March 2021,6,"It's a Will Ferrell comedy. Yep, a Will Ferrell comedy.""Poor family outsmarts a clueless, out-of-touch rich family and takes over the house"" is absolutely a Will Ferrell comedy plot.Ignore how beautiful the movie looks: the poor family's cramped, dirty house and the rich family's pristine, futuristic house.Ignore the fact that it's a foreign film: There must be a least a few people who LOVED the film because it's in a different language and liking the film makes them smart.If this was a Will Ferrell movie or a Steve Martin movie and it had the same dialogue and zany schemes, you would think the movie was average. Or maybe even terrible. One scene included the daughter leaving her underwear in the rich parents' car to trick them into thinking the driver had sex in it.Maybe the Will Ferrell/Steve Martin comparison is a little bit melodramatic. My point is, if you set aside the fact that it's an immensely well made foreign film (on a technical level!), Parasite is weak when it comes to characters and storytelling.There are no memorable characters in this movie (except for maybe a character that showed up near the end of the film, but only because he was so over-the-top). A perfect example is the poor family. They're basically the same person.For the most part, the rich couple are the usual snooty, dimwitted suburban snobs we've seen in plenty of mainstream garbage comedies.Most of the story is just the exchange between the poor family and the rich family. The back-and-forth between them was interesting, but definitely not Oscar-worthy.It's a bit difficult to rate the acting if the movie is in a different language. As far as I can tell, the acting was just okay. No groundbreaking performances. Just people sitting (or standing) around and talking with a few wacky comedic moments.Oh and there's a murder at the end that feels out of place.Obviously, movie isn't terrible. The visuals were incredible. The scene where the poor family's neighborhood was consumed by a flood was gorgeous.I enjoyed the film, but I wouldn't say it's the greatest film ever."
995,Finally something Gooood,rafaelgoncalo-87531,15 February 2020,10,An unexpected journey through an ironic a tragic account.
996,Don't Read This Review Unless You've Already Seen the Film,slammerhard,16 January 2020,7,"I liked this film even though I consider it overrated. There were several things that I found stupid while watching the film.The idea that someone is living in your home and you don't know it is not something new in Korean cinema. It has been explored before in Kim Ku Duk's 3-IRON.Having worked as an English teacher in Asian countries for two decades I found offensive the notion that someone with no credentials and no English skills will be able to pass off as an English teacher. Sorry folks, rich people are not that stupid.The same thing applies for the dad when he buys the Benz. The director seems to have forgotten there is something called background check and tax declaration. This film is nothing but pure fantasy.The ending where the daughter dies but not the son, reminded me of the ending of The Host. In Asian cultures the male offspring is more important than the female therefore its okay to sacrifice the girl if it ensures the survival of her brother. The director seems to respect tradition instead of opting for a messier finale.The final scene where the dad is trapped in the house is quite stupid and does not make any sense. It's more like a scene from a metaphysical horror film.The movie kinda fails as a depiction of class struggle because the rich people in this film are more likeable than the poor. You can't help rooting for the rich folks because they're the victims although if you're one of those antifa types you will most likely disagree.The fact is that in Asian countries there is no class struggle. It has been replaced by the ""Let's Get Rich"" mentality. No matter rich or poor everyone is equally greedy, however the low class peasants are generally looked down upon not because of their origin but because of their lack of taste."
997,Overrated,markellapappa,27 March 2020,5,"What a shame Parasite won the Oscars instead of 1917.
I was expected a masterpiece and felt really disappointed. It is like watching 2 different movies. Second half too surrealistic for my taste"
998,No words.,soraelizabeth,22 February 2020,10,"I was really sceptical about ""Parasite"" in a way because of the hype, but I also had fate in the movie being good because
Bong Joon-ho have delivered knock out after knockout. (Okja, Snowpiercer)
Also I really like Song Kang Ho previous works.
Most notably ""The Taxi Driver"", which left me crying my eyes out on a 8h flight.
Do not recommend.Anyways, Parasite is a masterpiece.
Every time I thought I'd figured the plot out there was a twist. Everyone also kept going on about the ending and I was like, meh.
Well, they were right about the ending.Can't describe this movie. The plot is as indescribable as Fight Club, Get Out or Us.Go watch it."
999,Perfection,olav-184-162371,15 February 2020,10,Perfect. What else can you say about the wonderful film.
1000,Incredible,aspeygabe,15 February 2020,9,"An incredible piece of cinema, pulls you in from the start, superb directing from Bong Joon-ho"

1002,This is EVERYTHING !,Maverick_Manish,16 February 2020,10,"Think of all movie genres you can think of and you will find a piece of everything in this movie.
This is unpredictable... this will intense. This will make you keep guessing and then you will be like wtf cuz none of your guesses would be right. This is everything."
1003,Masterpiece.,jp_91,13 February 2020,10,"Gisaengchung is an amazing film with a wonderful and strong script, amazing acting, beautiful cinematography and a great production design. The film is a comedy, a thriller and a strong drama. Parasites in two worlds, poor ones and rich ones. Rich being parasites to poor people, exploiting them and poor people getting better things from the rich using some tricks. This movie is mainly about poor people being parasites, with a strong direction. A wonderful film, a masterpiece!"
1004,A parasite so close to the nose you could almost smell it,Felix-Wackenhuth,2 August 2024,No rating,"I could probably sit down and write a page or two about what it is that makes this movie as good as it is but reading about how the mood, lighting, color scheme and camera makes this movie stand out from it competitors could be referred to as boring. Instead, I want to write about is how Parasite and the script from BongJoo Ho made us question ouresleves what a parasite truly is.A parasite would be something that in gain uses someone else. In a way the gain of the parasite in the movie is mutual to the two families, the poor family of Kim can be portrayed as a parasite for their way of getting under the skin of the other family and gaining from their wealth, but if you twist it their is arguably also a parasite in the Park family. Their way of using Lower society workers for their personal gain in keeping their lifestyle is really the true parasite of this movie.A certain element the movie had me thinking about was probably the rock. Yes, the rock, what more could it be to it than just a rock? My conclusion became that it must have been something more to it, the layer like an onion to this movie is just crazy many but the rook really had me thinking.The thing was that from the beginning to the end the rock was just a regular rock, sure if you find a rock and put it In a glass casket it can be portrayed as something more than it really is, almost like the rock being a parasite, gaining time and wealth for something it aint. Given to the Kim family in the beginning you came to believe the rock had more meaning than just a rock, but in the end when its put in a river it shown that it always just ben a rock, sure at one time it had its fame but in the end it shows a glimpse that when it all adds up we are all the same and that the rock was a parasite itself within the family of Kim.In a way the movies message and what I tend to believe BongJoo Ho wants to accomplish in this movie is to portray that we all in society in some way or another tend to be a parasite."
1005,Unsure,Wallsy10,12 February 2020,7,"Pleased for South Korean cinema it got the Oscar nod, but personally for South Korean cinema I much preferred The Handmaiden.
As a film from thus year's contenders, I liked 1917 the most"
1006,it's about time that the Oscars pay attention to these topics,lee_eisenberg,11 May 2020,10,"Bong Joon-ho's ""Gisaengchung"" (""Parasite"" in English) became the first foreign-language movie to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. And it was a deserved win. Like ""Joker"", it employs some unusual methods to address class conflict in modern society. To crown everything, it takes a subtly comedic approach to the topic!A lot of people had never heard of Bong before this movie. I've known about him ever since I saw ""The Host"". I've seen a couple of other Korean movies in addition to his movies. If this movie gets people interested in Korean cinema, then all the better; some great movies come from there. But in the meantime, this movie probably says more about modern society than just about any other movie from last year. Definitely see it."
1007,Extremely overrated,MoviesGivesLifeMeaning,11 September 2020,7,One of the most over rated movie of all time. It was good and one time watch movie but not worth all the hype it good because of being a foreign movie and people want to appreciate it but the appreciation went too far. And it got the awards like oscars because of less competition.
1008,Bong Joon Ho is Ki Woo,cnnorharrison,13 April 2020,5,"Despite its social commentary and clever cinematography, this movie is still kinda cliche, with predictable and forced plots, with cringeworthy acting here and there.BTW, Bong Joon Ho = Ki Woo, Hollywood = Park family."
1009,The people who give this review 7 or below and say it over-rated our probly very similar to the Parks,audioscope,16 February 2020,10,"This is a brilliant movie, just watch it without reading too many reviews, you won't regret it."
1010,Unexpected,mats123,15 February 2020,9,"Everyone says the film is about social class but I do not agree. That is just the setting. Like many Korean film makers the audience has no clue where the film is going. That is something I really appreciate. In the end it is not realistic, but entertaining.Does the film have a deeper message? Yes, but it is for discussion. The poorer family seems quite able, but somehow unable to work. Why? Maybe because they have psycho problems (e.g. father controlling his violence). And maybe that is why many able-looking people are poor. The richer family is very nice. How often are rich people taken in like that? Well quite often I would say if the acting is right."
1011,Devastating Filmmaking,matthewsjcha,17 February 2020,8,"With one of the most staggering turns in movie history, the stakes in what was already an extremely tense moment rose to an unprecedented level. The characters walk on such a fine line when trying to keep the other family fooled by their act that the film contains some of the most tense moments I have ever seen. The desperation and the lengths at which they go to left me in awe and made me question if their aim was still, if ever, worth it.With a finely crafted script, true emotion, and some beautifully positioned shots, this film is unforgiving and left me completely emptied and speechless in what was one of the most affecting movies I have seen. Parasite will stick with me for a long time."
1012,A perfect balance with an amazing message,anamojsoska,14 February 2020,9,"I have never seen a movie with such balance of genres, it went from a drama to romance to horror and almost a bit of every genre! i absolutely love how they slowly incorporated every family member into the rich family and just the whole storyline is pleasing and connects amazingly well. the instrumental played a huge role in its suspense and i loved it! i was constantly on the edge of my seat as the suspense was so perfect. The fact that Mr. Kim killed Mr. Park really explains the type of people Mr. Parks family were. In a dire situation, Mr. Park shut his nose because of the smell of Mr. Kim, this truly made a realization to Mr. Kim of the type of people they are. The clash of rich and poor, this clearly set Mr. Kim off, to kill him. I like the message at the end, it's very realistic. The son dreamt of buying the house to save his father, and it all would have been a happily ever after. But no, it is sadly a realistic and actual outcome of what the movie should've been. I respect it! Overall i am proud of this movies success and would watch it all over again and would still be surprised and struck by it."
1013,Excellent,lkobler-672-870759,15 February 2020,10,Will stay with you long after you leave the theater. Worthy of ever award and accolade that comes its way.
1014,Parasite is many different movies all at the same time.,rookpawn-38288,16 February 2020,10,"It works on so many levels it means so many things to different people you can see it in the reviews that are across youtube, rottentomatoes, etc.. Everyone has something different that sticks out for them and yet this film blends it so well.I know for a fact that this movie will be considered up there with The Godfather and Pulp Fiction in due time. It only just won Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Foreign Film Oscars and people will slowly start studying it more and more. When you see the best analysis channels like Nerdwriter write glowing essays on Parasite you know its hit its mark very deeply.Outward differences aside, this movie IMO is very similar to the ""What Could Go Wrong?"" Genre like in No Country for Old Men, A Simple Plan, but its also such a study and understanding in different socio-economic class, poor vs rich, and its fourth act is very Hitchcock.. This movie will stick with you and I am just glad that I was alive to see this movie. That's how good it is."
1015,Was a 10/10 until the very ending.,eliminate-02374,24 August 2023,7,"I do think this was a very good movie. Honestly I would love to rate the movie higher. Like the title says, it was a 10/10 until the very ending. I loved the characters and the set designs. The dialogue was very well scripted and the acting was great. Everything leading up to the very intense crescendo of the party and the stabbings was beautifully done. It was a slow burn that kept you guessing about what would happen. Again, I think this is an excellent movie. The only reason for my opinion that it's only a 7/10 is because at the very ending the movie basically says, hey just work hard for a couple of years and then you can get out of poverty... just a short couple of years and all your dreams come true. I guess I feel like the very ending made the rest of the movie feel kinda pointless. Maybe the was the intention? Just my opinion here."
1016,Wow,mmichniewicz-86394,15 February 2020,10,"Oscars, golden globe.. I had to see why. Now I know. my english is not good enough to say anything smart :) all I can say is wow.."
1017,The high ratings make for a worse experience,romy_chips,19 August 2024,6,"I've wanted to watch this for a while because of the high praise it has gotten. However, I think this made my experience worse. Because I had such high expectations, I felt a bit underwhelmed by this movie.Personally, I thought the first hour was unimaginably boring. Supposedly this is part comedy? I don't know where the comedy part was to be honest.The pace picked up in the second part, but I'm not sure if I liked this much better. Our main characters suddenly became so incompetent, it made the plot go into a bit of a weird direction.I have a conflicted opinion on this. On one hand, I can tell this movie had some real skills behind it. The camera shots, the acting, the details. Everything was thought through and that was quite obvious. For example I did appreciate the progression towards the dad's breakdown. The way we get little details on mr. Park. Although nice at first, we get more clues on how he sees his staff as less than him. The way he held his nose as he picked up his keys.Also, the very subtle hints at that the family is basically useless at everything, making you wonder who is really the parasite.So I get it, the symbolisms, metaphors. The cinematography was skillful.But if I think only 10% was wow-worthy, that doesn't make up for the other 90%. Maybe it needed that 90% for that 10%, but the 90% was just not enjoyable. If a movie is not enjoyable, it defeats the purpose of a movie. Movies can be an artform, but it's still supposed to give the watcher a good experience. In this case it just didn't give me that as much as I wanted it to."
1018,Didn't buy it,baunacholi-86159,10 December 2021,5,"Agreed, an interesting, original and twisted story. Here and there bits of social criticism but overall way too constructed for my taste. Ultimately I didn't get the hype and glowing reviews, leave alone true wow moments."
1019,Go in knowing nothing.,ripperman222,16 February 2020,10,"My dad is someone that doesn't even watch foreign films that require subtitles and he thought it was great. If thay doesn't cry out how great this film is then I don't know what.This screenplay is one of the best in a long time, incorporating elements that fit together like a puzzle, the characters are all deep and compelling, the score will be stuck in my head for a long time, and the story is one to go in without knowing anything. Bong Joon Ho is deserving of his Oscar wins and I hope this will introduce more Americans to South Korean films that are as good as Parasite."
1020,Masterpiece,quintiliusquan,15 February 2020,10,"I don't even know what to say. In fact, I don't even want to say anything about this movie. Just go see it if you haven't. You'll be glad you did."
1021,Deserved the oscar periodt.,bella-22272,16 February 2020,10,"This movie was freaking amazing!! On top of the genius commentary on class in developed countries and all the nuances it uses in that story, it is absolutely gorgeous. Every shot is piece of art, the editing and visuals are gorgeous and powerful in their symbolism. Plus the score is so so beautiful and emotional, you feel the tension in every moment. The pacing is also fantastic, it leans in slowly, exactly how you want a thriller to do. By the time you've reached the end of it you feel ""how did I get here"" but at the same time it makes total sense how you got there. The desperation portrayed by the actor's performances is also so genuine. Their acting capabilities are so overlooked too when you factor in all the fantastic elements of this movie. It more than meets the mark in every aspect. I would recommend it to almost anyone."
1022,Filmmaking Diploma,Vinayakvyas,12 February 2020,9,Every frame of this movie is a film diploma itself .. Surely one of the best movies in last 10 years
