      "First of all, I am a Korean. I've heard a lot about what Japanese people did to Korean people during the colonial era while I was growing up. That is very sad and making us Koreans furious. Because we Koreans heard a lot about similar stories, and the storyline follows actual historical events, this show feels a little cliche in my opinion. But, I think the cinematography is one of the best I've ever seen to describe the era. It is beautifully done and seems very real. Also the show's strategy to show events not by chronically, but by weaving related events through 3,4 generations is brilliant and is making the show interesting. Overall, it is worthwhile to watch, and to the people who didn't know the history between Japan and Korea, this will be a great show to understand the history and the emotions Koreans(or other countries which were impacted by Japan during the war) have.Although I believe we Koreans need to overcome this emotions about Japan and Japanese people, Japan also needs to admit its wrong doings in the past and truthfully express their apologies.\n",

      "Pachinko avoids the cliches of the K-drama, instead settles for an European soap drama style with plenty of depth, chronicling the plight of a Korean family under the Japanese occupation and juxtaposing that with life in 1989, all in brilliant cinematic storytelling.This series does not shy away from the effects of Japan's forced occupation on Korea. It plays out with an emotional impact from the viewpoint of Sunja's life via the unique structure in blending timelines. From Sunja's youth under Japan's stranglehold to that of her grandson in 1989. It depicts the various stages of Japan's influences on Sunja's family life, from war torn times to the might of the financial impact that Japan displayed during the 80's.It is an engrossing drama that reveals the horrors of life under a brutal occupation, and the long term effects it has on generational lives. All through the eyes of a strong protagonist, Sunja, played brilliantly by the various actors.\n",

      "Great cinematography, indeed- also costumes, locations, etc- technically all perfect, and very good casting. The script does not follow the book, which changes the view on characters, giving them different vibe - and also the jumping timelineis done so often and sometimes in the middle of the scene, that it does not allow the build-up of atmosphere, is pushing so many characters at the same time and prevents the viewer to really get to know them. I believe a linear story line would have been more beneficial by allowing viewers to connect to the characters, immerse in the story and also illuminate the attitude of the next generation. It seems a bit rushed and does not really gives that feeling of the family saga. Special Kudos for Kim Minha, who nailed her first leading role, and excellent performance from Lee Min Ho was perfect in Hansu. They succeeded also in expressing the relation between their characters, which is not described even in the book as love, but as passion between a 40 years old man in a loveless marriage and an innocent teenager. Looking forward to see the next episodes !\n",

      "If you've watched enough Korean dramas, you'd know that the story elements are not new revelations. They're an amalgamation of the history of Korea, and well-worn themes and stories of real lives of Koreans who've suffered at the hands of the Japanese, and the clash of cultures, attitudes, bigotry, hatred and cruelty, across Korean, Japanese and westerners. It's easy to forget that this was less than a hundred years ago, and spanning only a few decades; and so often, the bitterness still felt by Koreans leads to a heavy handed portrayal of the Japanese and westerners. It's a fine line to walk to be able tell a story about generations of a family and their personal struggles without getting lost in that bitterness.It's so amazing so far to see how beautifully the show tells the stories across multiple timelines, with incredible actors, excellent cinematography and direction. The contrast is striking, from the primitive Korean fishing village to the urban sprawl. While the show's synopsis is about their \"indomitable quest to survive and thrive\", it's the story of Korea and its people as whole being told through these four generations of characters.\n",

      "from Youn Yuh-Jung but the two younger actresses were just as good. For a newcomer Minha Kim is astounding.I've always considered Lee Minho to be a good actor, but apart from Gangnan Blues he has never had a part to really show what he can do when he gets a multi-layered character to play. He is great in this- and brings Hansu to life so well. The chemistry between him and Sunja was so well done by the two of them.Three episodes in this could be one of the best series I have seen for years. Awe-inspiring!\n",

In many other cases, they are kept on the screen so briefly that readers will miss parts of the dialogue.This is.a fine story, but there is no excuse for poor captioning -- it is a skill found easily everywhere in the world.\n",

      "I really wanted to love this series. I liked the novel a lot and was expecting changes in the film from such a sprawling, multi-generational novel. But what a mess the series turned out to be. Jumping from time to time, leaving out an entire generation, adding an entire episode about an earthquake which led nowhere... what disastrous choices. And all those plot threads that went no where... What happened to Noa? What happened to Isak? What happened to Isak and Sunja's baby? What happened to Yoseb? Where did Solomon come from (his entire parental generation is written out? Why were Hana and her mother so estranged?. And an entire episode devoted to an earthquake not in the novel and that advanced the story line very little. And what happened to WWII? And the last 15 or 20 mins of the finale... what the hell?The only reason I gave it a \"7\" was the wonderful acting of Youn Yuh-jung and, to a lessor extent, Jin Ha.I understand that book-to-film adaptations are usually disappointing but they should at least be coherent. I tried to explain what was happening to my wife who did not read the book but at times I was lost. Little wonder that she said the series was completely perplexing. So disappointing.\n",

      "I have seen in a number of other reviews that the original book on which this series is based tells the story in linear fashion. I am very much enjoying this series, but it is certainly spoiled by the modern trend of jumping about in time. It loses its flow and causes confusion as a consequence of this chip chop storytelling.A little bit of jumping about in time can work quite well. But here I am afraid they have made a hash of it and have overdone it.I ask filmmakers to worry less about being on trend and just have the courage to tell a story chronologically.That said, the cinematography is wonderful, the acting is fabulous and enormously engaging and this is a great story so far (I am about five episodes in). They have also chosen very good locations for the filming, including some striking dockside scenes filmed in Canada.In keeping with other reviewers, I also really like the introduction.\n",

      "I recently watched the show \"Pachinko\" and I have to say, it's absolutely amazing! Based on Min Jin Lee's novel, it tells the story of a Korean family over several generations, and it's so beautifully done. The way it switches between different time periods is really cool and keeps you hooked.The visuals are stunning. Every scene looks like a piece of art, and they've done an incredible job with the settings - you really feel like you're there in that time and place. The acting is top-notch, too. Youn Yuh-jung, who plays the grandmother, is just incredible. You can feel her strength and the love she has for her family in every scene.What I love most about \"Pachinko\" is how it explores deep themes like identity and family. It's emotional and heartfelt, and it really makes you think about what people go through when they're trying to find their place in the world. The story is so relatable even though it's set in a different culture and time.The writing feels genuine and the dialogue is really touching. Plus, the music fits perfectly and adds to the emotion of the scenes. Honestly, \"Pachinko\" is one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. It's not just entertaining - it's moving and inspiring. If you're looking for something that's both beautiful and meaningful, you've got to watch \"Pachinko.\" It's a show that stays with you long after you've finished watching.\n",

      "I loved the book and eagerly awaited the TV series...and I was incredibly disappointed. The show is bizarrely structured, with major developments being glossed over or not even shown onscreen, and minor conflicts stretched out over multiple episodes (or the entire season!) in weak attempts to create drama. HEAPS of melodrama added. Every character on the show seemed to cry once an episode. Which would be fine if it felt earned but it rarely does. The opening credits are pretty cringe to me and not at all fitting for the show or subject matter. Worst of all, the book, perfect for a limited series, has been needlessly extended into at least a second season, presumably more if they can stretch the material. Way more sizzle than steak.\n",

      " If only \"Pachinko\" was as good as its title sequence\n",

      "The title sequence knocks my socks off every time: so much joie de vivre, self-confidence and sexiness.... Unfortunately, the series itself doesn't find its tone at all.As a German viewer, I am free of prejudice and - sorry! - free of prior knowledge. I dutifully learn what \"Pachinko\" teaches me: that the cartoonishly evil Japanese brutally oppressed the Korean people in the early 20th century. Indeed, a bad gap in knowledge in my little universe on the other side of the world.I hope I'm not stepping on anyone's toes if this is still nothing more than a narrative premise for me. A starting situation that I, as a viewer, hope will develop. At least for the acting characters. But unfortunately, it doesn't. Instead, I'm told the same thing in every episode: cartoonishly evil Japanese subjugate our Korean main characters. Okay, I got it, why doesn't it continue?It's frustrating, but I know this stuckness in a \"narrative intent\" from my cultural background: when Nazi characters aren't allowed to awaken to flesh-and-blood human beings, as we would actually need them in order to understand our history, but must remain caricatures of evil - so we don't have to realize how similar some of them are and how human fellow travelers really are. An impertinent insinuation, some of you may think - for many Germans it is now a fact: there is evil in every one of us..... I'm only sending this ahead to explain why the Korean victimhood in \"Pachinko\" makes me suspicious.So the series doesn't win me over on that front. Unfortunately, it doesn't win on any other front either: narratively, acting-wise, this series can't keep up at all with all the great narratives that \"Pachinko\" is lined up with just by rating here on imdb. Narratively really thin, individual actors* are nevertheless outstanding: starting with the 6-year-old Sunja (unfortunately abercounted too early), to her mother, to the pastor Sunja marries.... Great performances. Which nevertheless get lost in bad storytelling.I would like to shout to the makers of the series that they should not underestimate us as an audience. We understand, even from the other side of the world. Even though we don't know the details of your story, we have experienced similar things. Please don't lecture us - tell us stories of people who fascinate us. Being victimized is not automatically fascinating.\n",
